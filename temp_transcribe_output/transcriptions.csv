And the reason why he's under investigation is because of the part that he's played in the Game Stock Pump, which has made him and many others millionaires. And he's done that simply by putting memes on his social media accounts that have led to a frenzy of trading in GameStop stock. So now the question becomes, were Roaring Kitty's GameStop posts illegal? And we're going to hear about this from an SEC lawyer to explain why exactly he's under investigation. Now the article starts by saying when Roaring Kitty came back to social media nearly a month ago, shares of GameStop jumped. But is that enough to qualify as market manipulation? Important to note as well, he has 1.4 million followers on Twitter alone. Then it appears on May 12th, Roaring Kitty's account on X came back to life and started sharing memes. The following day GameStop shares rose 74% and jumped another 60% on the next day. On June 2nd, Roaring Kitty began posting on his old Reddit account, this time sharing screenshots of an e-trade.",en,11.68

High earners contribute directly to a Roth IRA when their income exceeds the income limits. First, income limits make Roth contributions off limits for families earning more than $236,000 in 2025 or $150,000 for a single filer in 2025. Many high earners don't actually realize they're above the income limits when they make these contributions, but it turns out it creates a huge headache for themselves when they have to deal with these excess contributions. Second, high earners will oftentimes benefit most from contributing to their retirement plans at work. Think 401k plan or 403b. Contributing to these types of retirement plans allow them to reduce their taxable income during their peak earning years, which is when they need it most. Third, your investment account of choice should really fit into your overall financial plan. I once helped this OBGYN who was making over $500,000 a year by contributing the max to her 403b and maxing out the backdoor Roth IRA. She was still only at about a 6% savings rate for her retirement, which is not nearly enough to accomplish the goal for early retirement by age 50. So working together allowed me to find the next best place for her to be saving for her financial future.

So if you buy an option premium before earnings, let's just say the earnings are going to report after the market. We have Apple here, it's going to report after the market. So you purchase a premium right before the market close, but even though this Apple price may increase, it seems like your profits decrease after the earnings report. Now that's due to something called implied volatility. Now that implied volatility crush drops after big events. The premiums get inflated before the earnings because everyone's expecting a big move. After the report, the implied volatility will collapse and your option value will tank, even if the stock moves your way. So that's something you have to be careful if you're going to buy before an earnings report. So don't get crushed by implied volatility, which is right here. Trade after the storm, not before or during the storm. So follow me for more ways to keep your profits safe while you're trading smart.",en,10.43

He has a, he has a. He has a. He has a. He has a. He does. That is, that is Trump's derangement syndrome works both ways. If you don't recognize that he has malignant narcissistic, whatever they call that. It's not just a, it's just not a personality quirk. It's that, that would be one thing. We all have personality quirks. This is a disease. If somebody tells him, he's a brilliant guy and very handsome, you own him. That's the most dangerous thing in a president. He doesn't make decisions rationally. The reason why he's so ahead is because he doesn't have to worry about policy points that he makes because no one takes him seriously anyway. He's all over the map. He pulls it out of his ass. He changes one day for the next. So no one ever takes him seriously. It's the greatest advantage a politician can have. So Bill Maher makes some really good points here. So obviously this is in response to, you know, Kelly N Conway regurgitating the notion that President Biden is mentally unfit for office, whereas Donald Trump is. Now, I just want to address this because it's a, you know, it's a pet peeve of mine. The very same polls which question President Biden's mental fitness, also question Donald Trump's. OK, so this is recent from Pew Research. A defining characteristic of the contest is that voters overall have little confidence in either candidate across a range of key trades, including fitness for office, personal ethics and respect for democratic values. Where Trump has the advantage. More than a third of voters say they're extremely or very confident that Trump has the physical fitness and mental fitness needed to do the job of president. So again, and I'll show this here as well. This is from Fox News. Fox News. OK, of all places, it says most voters doubt Biden's physical and mental fitness to be president, Trump's ability to act ethically. But again, when you break it down, Trump garnered more confidence from respondents regarding both physical and mental fitness with roughly 36 percent, saying they're extremely or very confident he's physically fit for office. As far as being mentally fit, 38 percent were extremely or very confident in the former president. So as we've discussed before, this is something where Biden is at a disadvantage with respect to polling, but still a majority of Americans in the same polls say that Donald Trump is mentally unfit for office. Now, you can say that it's worse for Biden with respect to the polls. And that's fine. But you have to acknowledge if you're being good faith, which Kelly and Conway is obviously not.",en,23.44

In the mid-1980s, the Iran-Contra affair shocked America. Conservative officials, some dressed in crisp marine uniforms and others in business suits under the American flag, orchestrated a covert operation that would become one of the most controversial political scandals in US history. The Reagan administration sold arms to Iran, then under strict embargo in hopes of securing the release of American hostages. The proceeds were secretly funneled to support the Contra rebels fighting the socialist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. These operations bypassed congressional bans, echoing covert tactics from centuries past. When the story broke, handwritten notes, secret memos in English, and crates of military equipment became evidence. The cover-up unraveled under congressional hearings, with iconic testimonies and American flags displayed prominently. This event remains a powerful reminder that even in modern times, the lessons of history are ignored at our peril. Like, follow, and share for more riveting truths.",en,10.18

This is all on the Republicans. They own the House, they own the Senate, they own the fucking presidency. They chose this. Democrats came to them with an easy ask. Get rid of the Medicaid cuts from the big bullshit bill, and continue funding the Affordable Care Act tax credits so that millions of Americans don't get whacked with higher insurance costs. And Republicans refused. Not only did they refuse, they spent the last few days spreading a crock of bullshit about how Democrats want free healthcare for undocumented immigrants, which is patently false, and even their own conservative news has fact-checked them on this. While Democrats were ready to get to work to avoid this whole mess, Trump was on a fucking golf course, truiting pictures of Hakeem Jeffries in a sombrero, and Mike Johnson canceled work.

This is why we're waiting on the Clarity Act. And MasterCard just announced that their stable coin card you're going to be able to spend stable coins at 250 million MasterCard locations worldwide. These are our new digital dollars. But stable coins are not crypto. They're just digital representations of the US dollar, which has already lost 97% of its purchasing power. That means your dollar today is worth about three pennies from what it used to be. When they flip this system, those stable coins are going to unpeg from the old US dollar and they're going to repeg it to whatever new gold silverback dollar we've got coming in this new system. That's when the exchange rate hits. You cannot trade a dollar worth three pennies evenly for a dollar worth a hundred pennies.

Ida B. Wells faced this horror and chose to fight back. Born into slavery in 1862, Wells grew up to become a fierce journalist. She uncovered shocking truths about the brutality of lynching in America. In 1892, after the lynching of three friends, Wells began her investigation. She found most victims were black men falsely accused of crimes. They tried to silence her with threats and violence. Her office was destroyed, but Ida didn't back down. She sharpened her pen and continued her battle. Wells published detailed reports, exposing lies and advocating for justice. She traveled, giving lectures and spreading awareness despite constant danger. Her work laid the foundation for the civil rights movement. Wells proved that fearless journalism could challenge systemic racism and provoke change. Ida's legacy reminds us that courage and truth can overcome oppression. Her relentless fight against lynching is a beacon of hope and justice. As Wells famously said, they tried to silence me with fear, but I sharpened my pen and fought back.

Despite the current Democrat-induced shutdown, we will get our service members every last penny. Don't worry about it. The president today blaming Democrats for his administration's plan to fire federal workers. Taking place right now. It's all because of the Democrats. The Democrats are causing the loss of a lot of jobs with their shutdown. It's the White House's decision to let them go. Are you worried about getting laid off? Very. I've been there for 20 years. I love my job. Tammy Ford comes from a family of federal employees, and right now she's working without pay. Not having a paycheck, not having our resources to rely on is going to be very difficult with daycare medications and just everyday living. The consequences of the shutdown are now a reality for millions of Americans. Consideration should be given to the bulk of the people who are suffering right now. Americans who don't work for the government are still feeling the pain. Food benefits to moms and young children could dry up in days. Social security checks are still going out, but be prepared to wait longer. And national parks and monuments partially closed. The Smithsonian now saying museums will close next weekend if the shutdowns still on. The stalemate in Washington due to Democrats' demands that Republicans address health care issues in the funding bill. Are you open to extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies? We want to fix it so it works if not working. Obamacare has been a disaster for the people, so we want to have it fixed so it works. The subsidies expired this year and could spike premiums for Americans. How do Americans who are struggling, sitting at the table Friday night figuring out how to pay the bills, how the heck can they get such an increase? But Republicans say no negotiations until Democrats reopen the government. We need them to turn the lights back on so that everyone can do their work. Julie is joining us from the White House tonight and Julie, one of the key data points moving forward could be how Americans see the blame game in all this. Absolutely, Hallie.

A stock is nothing but a piece of a company. If you buy one share of Apple, it means you own 0.000001% of Apple. Congratulations! A mutual fund is a bucket where lots of people put in money and a fund manager uses that money to trade equities and generate profit. And you will pay something called a management fee to the fund manager for maintaining your principal and generating the profit. An ETF stands for exchange traded fund. It is a basket of multiple hand-picked companies that you can buy and sell in the stock market like a single stock. For example, SPY is an S&P 500 ETF. If you buy one stock of SPY, your money will be divided into top 500 companies of the United States. The management fee for an ETF is much lower when compared to mutual funds.

A teleprompter, Wally. You're right, Seth. Sorry, buddy. It's all good. I can't stay mad at you, Wally. For more on this, well, not this. Wally, like actual new stuff. It's time for a closer look. Welcome to the show. Republicans can't seem to decide how they feel about the shutdown. On the one hand, they keep insisting that a shutdown is bad because of all the programs that will lose funding. We won't have FEMA funded, right? We've got hurricanes, hurricane season. We've got two off the coast of the United States right now. FEMA service is not funded. FEMA will be funded. We have hurricanes off the coast of the United States right now. This is serious business. He talks about the hurricanes like he's threatening us with them. I got a few hurricanes off the coast right now. It would be a real shame. Real shame if I gave him a call and told him to hit land. You know, the only problem with that, of course, is how hurricanes never have threatening names. You don't want to meet my friends, Irma and Milton. The point is, Republicans say a shutdown is bad because FEMA will lose funding and they're right. I mean, who in their right mind would want to shut down FEMA? President Donald Trump says he plans to dismantle FEMA after the 2025 hurricane season shifting natural disaster recovery responsibilities to the states. It was a disaster, FEMA. And has that worked out well? I think, frankly, FEMA's not good. I think we're going to recommend that FEMA go away. Wait until Mike Johnson hears about this. Trump made such a mess out of his argument. He's going to need FEMA to clean it up. And by the way, Trump said that at the site of a hurricane. He's ripping on the agency in charge of responding to the disaster he is there to see. Imagine your house is burning down and instead of the fire department, a guy shows up and says, they're no good at fires anymore. They suck at fires. Don't waste your time. Just give everybody a big bucket of water that says for emergencies only. So which is it? Should we fund FEMA or eliminate it? Can you explain Mike Johnson?",en,34.85

Let's start as usual on the 4-hour timeframe. From the 4-hour chart, we can see that the previous candle just closed above 6,787, which for me confirms bullish momentum. Price wants to continue pushing up toward the all-time high again. Now, on the downside, I don't want to see any 4-hour candle close below 6,762, because that would be the first sign that the market might want to shift direction. But for now, I remain bullish for today. Alright, now let's move down to the 1-hour timeframe. On the 1-hour chart, we can spot some liquidity sitting around 6,771. It's still okay if price dips down too. Tap that level, and then continues to climb higher. For the upside, my target remains at the previous all-time high, near 6,800. That's the level I'll be watching for a possible reaction. Now switching to the 15-minute timeframe, we can see a small fair value gap right here on the green highlight zone. That's an area where price could come back. Fill in the imbalance, and then continue to push higher. Alternatively, if momentum stays strong, we could just continue to see a steady push up throughout the session without revisiting that zone. And that's my prediction path for today.

And your burn is simply how much it costs to exist, how much it costs to live your life or run your business. And the benefit is most businesses do understand what they're spending per month and what it costs to keep them alive. Whereas individuals were not always the best at understanding how much we're spending from the mortgages, the fixed expenses, and things you have to pay for, insurance, all that good stuff, and then the variable expenses. So going out, travel, shopping, when you're looking year to year or month to month, it helps a ton to be able to understand how much are we spending, how can we continue to live a solid, wealthy life, but also making sure that we're saving enough for taxes. We're putting enough towards the protection pieces like insurance, and we're also saving and planning for the future appropriately.",en,9.97

And I'm going to tell you why. Some programs, especially Maryland mortgage programs are not forgiving, especially if you get, let's say, $20,000, $30,000 towards your closing costs or your down payment. Well, assuming you want to refinance your loans, you have to pay that money back or roll that into your loan. So recently I have a client that couldn't refinance their house because they use the program and when they did that pre-sale, he didn't have enough equity to be able to get the new rate, meaning that the program hindered him from being able to refinance the house because you have to pay back that $20,000, $30,000. And this was the formation that they didn't know. So I want to make sure you understand when you are buying a house and the lender offers you a program, make sure you understand if it is a forgiving or not forgiving. If it's not forgiving, you have to understand the pros and the cons when you use this program, meaning that it could hinder you from refinancing in the future or you know at the back of your mind you have to pay that money back when you refinance. Well, those programs are great for first time home buyers because if you don't have a house, it's a great incentive to get in it to a home. But you may have to understand the pros and the cons of using the program. And I personally like the programs that are free. And as a real estate agent, my job is to point out these things to you to make sure that you understand which one is free, which one is free. So you can make an informed decision for yourself.",en,16.65

His first crisis was COVID-19, and I think he did an exceptional job. Out the gate, he promised 100 million vaccinations in the first 100 days of his presidency. And he overperformed so much that he actually ended up augmenting his promise to 200 million vaccines in 100 days, and he hit that goal. Next, he passed the American Rescue Plan, which was designed to keep the economy from falling off a cliff during a global pandemic. And it did exactly that, despite the complaints from his opponents. Next is immigration, which was unquestionably Joe Biden's worst area as president. This massive influx you see here was during a two-year period where, for the life of me, I do not understand why Joe Biden did not address the problem directly. He waited until April of 2024 to issue executive actions that did stem the tide of the influx, which you can see right there. But he could have done that years prior and just chose not to. His argument is that he was trying to get a long-term solution in place, but he could have easily just done this in the short term to show that he was serious about the problem and chose not to do that.

It was a stunning move by SNL because MAGA World has been losing it with the NFL's choice of choosing Bad Bunny for this year's halftime show. Now SNL has been trolling Trump ever since he came down the escalator to announce his presidency and call Mexicans rapists. But that trolling usually consists of actors and comedians playing Trump or his staff. Last night's choice of Bad Bunny to host was a total in-your-face move on SNL's part to push back against the white Christian nationalism that fuels the MAGA movement and Trump's power base. And when you get right down to it, MAGA has two problems with Bad Bunny. He's Hispanic and he speaks Spanish. That's it. That's their beef. Their howling about Bad Bunny has nothing to do with his music. The guy is a worldwide music superstar. This isn't a bunch of rock and rollers sneering at disco. Now this is a bunch of rednecks angry that someone who is not white and speaks Spanish makes more money than they do. This is a bunch of monolingual people who weren't smart enough to learn Spanish in high school, angry that white privilege is losing its grip, but they're the only ones who are losing because of it. Rich white men are still on top. Ask Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk, who's not even American. And this is precisely what Bad Bunny and SNL decided to serve up in the opening monologue. Take a look at what can only be considered a historic moment in U.S. television. Not just live television or comedy television, but all of U.S. television history. Here it is. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's good to be back. This is my second time hosting and my fourth time being here. I think Marcelo is getting nervous that Lauren has a new favorite Latino. I am. I am. The genius of this monologue was clearly creating a great gag out of an historic moment for U.S. television. That is the longest preplanned, scripted, but unsubtitled Spanish monologue on broadcast television of all time. It is an acknowledgement of what we all know. An enormous amount of people in this country speak Spanish. ABC, SNL, and Bad Bunny put it out there to assert that fact. And most importantly, to not accommodate those people who are so resentful of Spanish becoming a part of American culture. And the gag turns on that fact brilliantly.",en,21.8

Starting with the craziest, he said that the Senate passed a bill for sanctions on Russia, but they passed it in a certain way so that he has a choice whether or not he has to sign it. Proving he does not understand the veto power of the presidency and is probably the reason why he signs every piece of paper placed in front of him without reading it. Okay, he mentioned Biden 9 times, Obama 4 times, and the fake news 8 times, and then the other members of his cabinet who were there mentioned Biden 6 more times. He said the big beautiful bill would have had to have been broken into 7 different bills to get passed and some of those wouldn't have gotten passed because they had nothing that benefited any Americans in them. So he admitted large sections of his bill have nothing that's beneficial to any American, except the ultra-wealthy. Regarding the flood in Texas, he called it a wave and said we've never had a wave like this except if dams have broken before and he says that at one point there were so many helicopters in the sky that it became dangerous. He claims the tariff date always has been August 1st and that the media is just lying saying that he changed that.

Realistically, we know that Ripple has been strategically laying the foundation for a decentralized financial ecosystem for over a decade. They've been partnering with banks, central banks, and governments. And XRP is being used as part of the US crypto reserve, so the entire financial landscape is about to dramatically shift in XRP's favor. So how does this change the scenario? Number one, XRP becomes the global reserve bridge asset. Since XRP is being backed in the US crypto reserve, it's signaled that it is a strategic financial tool, potentially being integrated into the monetary policy. It could act as a bridge asset between digital and fiat currencies facilitating CBDC interoperability on a global scale. This would likely cause an immediate institutional liquidity surge, pushing demand in prices exponentially higher. Number two, central banks and government adoption solidifies XRP's role. Ripple's partnership with over 170 banks and financial institutions suggests that XRP's infrastructure is a big part of the US crypto reserve.",en,12.54

So there's no easy answer to that. So my advice to pro-life couples that want to do it, try to push back on the doctor and say, we're going to trust God and we only want to implant the embryos that we would be comfortable raising. Do not act as if it's like a roulette table. Like, look, we're going to lose some of them. And I know we're not going to raise all those kids. If you fertilize the egg and then it doesn't attach to the wall with the full intent of raising those kids, that's more morally justifiable. Other than we're going to throw six ones up against the wall and see which ones stick. That one I find to be bordering on eugenics. I know that sounds to be a provocative statement, but it is basically we're going to kill five to let one live. Does that make sense? And all to be it, you guys are going to have a great life because of IVF, and I think that's a beautiful thing. So thank you. Thank you very much. Yes, I do have another, just like one more. What would it take for you, you kind of like answered it, but what would it take for you to be like borderline morally okay with IVF? If we are able to... I think I've articulated it. It would largely invalidate the IVF. What I've just articulated would make the IVF outcomes go down dramatically because the reason why IVF outcomes are able to be successful is that each round of IVF, if it does not attach to the uterine wall, the doctor says, well, we did six, let's do 10. And let's do 15. Let's do 25. Now that's extreme, but it does happen where they want a baby so badly they're just going to throw everything they possibly can. What ends up happening is then they give the mom a predesturone, which then basically makes the uterine wall quote unquote sticky during her time of ovulation, which then can make the baby that attached to the uterine wall. No easy answer. I think so last final point, infertility I think is a symptom. It is not in itself a sickness. Infertility I think is a symptom of terrible diet, of genetic issues that we're not able to necessarily understand. And in my opinion, I think there are toxins that are poisoning us that are artificially lowing testosterone rates and young ladies, I'm going to get so much hate for this. If you never want to deal with infertility, be very careful taking the pill. The pill has a lot more downsides than they will ever tell you. Be very careful. As a man, I know I'm not allowed to say that. There's a lot of downsides to the pill. And am I allowed to say it? Thank you. Yes, you are. Yes, sir. Because the pill will dramatically increase your likelihood of going to an IVF industry clinic. Do you want to know the even more sinister take? If I was just caring about profit, I would try to get a bunch of 14 year old girls on a birth control pill to addict them as an annuity, have them not want to have kids until they're 30s, then they're 30s, then they're infertile, then they have to come to me and buy IVF services. That's only if you'd want to make a bunch of money, though. Thank you so much for your time. God bless you both. Maybe please. Yes, you got two hats because you're twins. Thank you so much.

Did you know you can take over someone else's VALone? It's called a VALone assumption. And the biggest benefit here is that you get to take over someone else's potentially low VALone rate. Now, I've seen homes for sale right now where sellers are advertising a VALone rate of 1.75% that you can assume. Now, not all homes will have that 1.75% rate, but they'll typically have a much lower interest rate than what we're seeing right now in today's market. If you want to know how to easily search for homes that qualify for a VALone assumption, comment info below and I'll share with you all the details.

Let's take a look at some info Here's the deal our agricultural industry is under pressure Demand from China for US soybeans is way down and fertilizer costs is sky-high So the administration is considering using tariff money and other special funds to help farmers So in order for us to benefit from this let's take a look at what companies might benefit from this First I think would be fertilizer makers. We can think of companies like CF Industries Or the mosaic company Basically if farmers get checks they'll buy fertilizer for next planting season Secondly, we can keep an eye on seed and crop chemical companies like Cortiva with the government increasing demand Should increase seed sales Next we can look at the farm equipment manufacturers like Agco and John Deere It's payouts to the farmer mean cash for servicing the equipment buying parts and buying new tractors And a fun little fact that I learned recently was that John Deere bought a company called Blue River in 2017 And reading from their company page here. It says that Blue River uses computer vision machine learning AI and robotics to create intelligent machinery for precision agriculture Their main innovation today is the sea inspirase system which uses cameras and AI to identify individual weeds in a field and applies herbicide to only the weed significantly reducing chemical usage Hey to me it sounds like maybe the crops will be a little healthier to eat And lastly the agribusiness processors and traders like ADM and rumble And to me out of all the charts I've shown the screen so far I think ADM is the most interesting you can see it's the monthly chart here that you know We have this little wave up match with this here created a Resistance level that we just broke through and we're going back to test But then on the weekly you can see we've had a nice run up creating a nice bull flag pattern. I Don't think I'm buying anything yet off the speculative news But I'm just trying to create a plan for if it does happen But also I pose the question to you all if the farmers do receive a bailout from the US government What industries or specific companies would you be looking to invest in?

I want to remind you that in about 30 days, we will be as far from the midterms as we are from Election Day 2024. And while on one hand that night feels like it was a thousand years ago, it also kind of feels like it was yesterday, because this shit has been crazy. And it's been crazy for a year because the chaos didn't begin on inauguration day. It began the day after the election. Now before you say, well, there are still three years left, I beg you to remember that not all presidential years are equal. Back in February and March, Trump and Doge felt unstoppable. Every single day was a new aftershock in the earthquake of doom. Threats layoffs and new executive orders every single morning. And in June it felt like by the fall the American military would be in every major city. And yet here we are. The color of the nation is changing like the color of the trees. Because yeah, he came in with momentum, but now everybody blames him for everything. And if you really look hard, tariffs are the only thing he has left. Those of us who have been paying really close attention, we picked up on the fact that the latest tariffs he announced, he tried to announce his national security concern, which would exempt them from the Supreme Court ruling, which I think he knows is coming. If and when it does, they side against him. Two-thirds of his tariffs will disappear and the IRS will be forced to refund them to American business owners. And if that happens, Donald Trump will be rooting against tax returns. The small business is what a sight. Which means the timeline we're on right now looks like this. Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's, and then the midterm campaigns begin. Please understand, if you thought town halls were bad, public and politicians could simply choose not to have them. But campaigning? These Republican members of the House and the Senate need to go back to their states and ask people for their vote. And when they do, when they start asking people for donations, when they take the debate stage against primary and general election rivals, they're going to hear from the American people. And when they do, they're going to realize that if they want to keep their career, they're going to have to run from Trump's agenda faster than Trump runs from his phone when E.G. Carrell's lawyer is calling. Which means this thing that we're in right now is maybe three to four more months before the whole conversation changes. And while it's not going to be fun, at least we're going to have a bunch of Christmas rom-coms to distract us. And when Republican politicians come to grips with the fact that in the very near future, they're going to have to choose between their political career and that lame duck comb-over clog currently circling the drain of irrelevancy.",en,24.77

China is collapsing right now, and it's way worse than you could possibly think. Their economy, it's falling apart. Their real estate market, completely imploding. And I'm talking 60 million homes that are completely empty. Whole cities built for no one. Families spent their entire life savings on apartments that were never finished. No water, no power, just concrete shells. And what's wild is, they're actually living in them because there's nowhere else to go. And then what about the banks? Well, they're freezing with draws. People are going to get their money and it's gone. There's nothing to find. Factory workers haven't been paid in months. The job market is terrible where these college grads are flooding the market and not finding anything. People are boycotting their mortgage payments and protesting in the streets. You have the CCP. They're not doing anything about it. They're doing what they always do. They're creating videos, arresting citizens and silencing dissent. And you remember Evergrande? You remember that? That was just the beginning. The truth is, the entire real estate sector was basically one big Ponzi scheme over there where developers were selling homes before even building them. Then taking the money to buy even more land, all the while the government looked the other way because they were the ones that were making money off it too. Now it's all falling apart. And here's the scary thing of it all. In China, most families don't even own stocks or businesses. Their home is their life savings. So when housing prices collapse, everything around it collapses.

Amos33 says, do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so. Without agreement, it's very difficult to walk together. Here's how it works for our family of six.

You need to let your money work for you. A lot of people look at investing as a complicated thing. They think you got to have a lot of money to invest or, you know, investing is just for older people. You need to start it while you're young because the power of compound interest is crazy and it's very simple. They have a lot of different apps you can use now, like I use Fidelity, Coinbase and Robinhood to invest. Coinbase is basically my cryptos. Robinhood, I have an individual account and a Roth IRA retirement account. And then Fidelity is kind of just like my free thing where I just fuck around on there and invest in random stocks. But basically all you do is transfer money from your bank account to these apps and then you pick whichever stocks you want. You know, you can look online, what are the best stocks to buy? But I invest mostly in the S&P 500 and then I'll invest in the companies that I actually like and use, you know, on the daily basis. So yeah, you need to start getting into investing while you're at a younger age because over time of compounding interest will fucking build that money up. And a lot of my money goes into my Roth IRA account, my retirement account. And that's money, whatever money I invest, I can take out whenever I want without a penalty. But once you start getting into the profits and taking those out, you'll get taxed on and get penalized on. So you don't want to mess with it. But yeah, if you start investing now while you're in your 20s, whenever you retire at 65, you will damn near be a millionaire if you do it right. So play your cards right.",en,16.13

Inflationsdaten, die diese Woche rauskommen, die haben es definitiv in sich und die schauen wir uns gemeinsam an, plus wir klackt erlassen, let's go. Morgen kommen schon die PPI-Daten, also die Producer-Price-Index-Daten. Sie werden uns offenlegen, ob die Inflation in die Produktionen steigt oder sinkt. Das ist oft wiederum der Vorbote für die Verbraucherpreise. Und wenn ihr gedacht habt, das war schon spannend, liebe Freunde, zieht euch warm an, der Donnerstag, der wird erst richtig spannend. Es geht nämlich schon mal los mit der EZB-Zinsentscheidung in Europa. Wird die EZB die Zinsen senken, wird es einen Mega-Push geben in den Märkten. Zeitgleich werden die CPI-Daten in der USA veröffentlicht, also der Consumer-Price-Index. Ein extrem wichtiger Schlüsselindikator, der weltweit Beachtung findet, weil er direkt einen Einfluss auf die Fettentscheidung haben will. Des Weiteren werden am Donnerstag die Arbeitslosenquoten bzw. die Erstanträge für die Arbeitslosendaten veröffentlicht. Das wiederum wird uns genau folgendes sagen. Weniger Anträge, starker Arbeitsmarkt. Weniger Grund, die Zinsen zu senken. Dieses Zusammenspiel aller Daten kann für extreme Volatilität für diese Woche sorgen. Sprich, schnelle und starke Marktbewegungen in beide Richtungen. Abschließend möchte ich euch natürlich dazu noch sagen, wer vorbereitet ist, kann Chancen nutzen. Beistens nicht vorbereitet ist, wird eiskalt überrascht. Aber das ist ja auch nichts Neues, liebe Freunde. Jetzt bin ich aber gespannt, was eure Meinung zu dieser Woche ist. Viel Volatilität.

Hey everybody, it's your girl Steph. Here to help you win with what you already have. And if that's a question you've been asking yourself, here are three things to think about. Number one, and I always start with this, what are you passionate about? And more specifically, what problems are you passionate about solving? There's going to be a connection there. Secondly, what do people come to you about or what are the solutions that people are already asking to help them with? This is going to show you not just what you're passionate about, but where is the need, and you can be able to solve. And when you think about that, you also want to think about what AI really is not going to be able to replace. So what's that human connection, that creative piece that's really going to give you that advantage? Third, how you can be able to work with or alongside AI. So the truth of the matter is, as we think about our careers and business development going forward, it's never going to be completely without AI. So instead of ignoring AI completely, think about how the problem that you solve can be enhanced with the help of AI. Or the solution that you offer in your career or in your business, how can that be enhanced with AI? It's going to put you ahead. It's all going to help you be able to be creative as you think about your next solution. I hope this was helpful. If you want this list sent directly to you, DM me AI and I'll send it right over.

I'm now the one relearning my own advice. This is Fixing My Finances Day 2 and today I want to talk about where things actually stand for me right now. And I'll be honest, I don't know how comfortable I am sharing exact numbers yet. When I was a full-time money influencer, I talked about the ins and outs of my finances every single day but life looks different now. I'm 38, I'm a mom, I have more on my plate and more at stake. I'm mindful about what I share publicly these days because co-parenting and life online can be a delicate balance. When I had my old website, I used to tell people to spend 4 minutes a day with their finances and somewhere along the way for me that slipped. And so now on this new chapter, I'm taking my own advice again. 4-10 minutes a day, nothing fancy, just opening my apps, reviewing transactions and moving money where it needs to go. My friend Jesse Farron calls these little money moves and honestly they help me feel back in control. So here are all my little money moves from the last week, some big, some small.

It is September 29th, early Monday morning. Something I think I want to start doing for you all kind of on a monthly and weekly basis is I want to kind of put together some content to share with you all as pertains to the Pensacola market specifically, kind of from a ground level. And just on a week to week basis kind of give you kind of a little bit of a snapshot. Maybe we can identify some trends that could be beneficial to you guys, whether you're a potential buyer or seller in this market and how it affects you and the approach that we should consider talking about taking. So I'll do it every Monday. I'm going to call it my Monday morning market monitor. So to kick things off, for my first video, in the past seven days we have added 289 new listings to our inventory. That brings us to a total of 3444 active listings in our MLS. Now that's just residential. No commercial, no land, nothing like that. Just place you can resign in. Okay. In the past seven days we have sold 183. That gives us a net positive 106 new listings in our active MLS. Now on average we're selling 6755 a month. Why that number is important to know because it kind of gives us an idea of our monthly supply right now is four and a half. Below five, which tells us we're in a seller's market. Okay. Anything five months or below is seller's market five to seven months worth of supply as a balanced market. Seven months supply or more as a buyer's market. But guys, I would argue we're in more of a buyer's market than anything right now just because of the concessions we're seeing being given back, the reduction in prices coming off, the sellers are coming off of because they've got a lot of competition right now, right? And then they're buying down interest rates for buyers. New construction is offering buyers and it's like I've never seen before. So I would argue that we are in more of a buyer's market than we are anything else right now. So something to think about. And like I said, you have no competition right now. None as a buyer. You have none. All right. Of the 3444 active listings, 428 of them, that's 12% have had a price reduction and probably more than one. Again, these sellers are motivated, right? That benefits you guys as a buyer. Another number that we're monitoring and looking at is how many listings are expiring. The past seven days, 39 for the month, 289. That's 9% of the current market inventory that is expired. That number has been hovering between 8% to 10%, which is higher than we've seen in a long time. So look, how does this benefit you guys? These are questions you should be asking if you're a potential buyer seller and the approach that you should consider talking about taking. So if you have any questions, reach out. We'll do this every Monday. Tune in. Get some information that can be beneficial for you, anyone else. Again, Robert here with Keller and his Gulf Coast Realty. Thanks for chiming in. And let me know if you have any questions and we'll talk to you later. Have a good one.",en,27.05

Get white bright lights. Get the highest wattage that you can. Number two, let's talk doors. Do they stick? They might need to be adjusted. Do the hinges squeak loudly when you open the door?

So there's a couple things that you can do. The first is going to be painting the ceiling a lighter color than your other walls. You might be thinking, oh wow, I never really thought to paint the ceiling a different color. But this is definitely going to be a trick that you can use to just create that optical illusion. Now another thing is just utilizing mirrors. So many people do not use mirrors enough for decor. They only use mirrors as a practical item. But mirrors actually bounce light. When more light comes into a room, it appears a bigger. So do not be afraid to decorate with oversized mirrors. And that goes for bedrooms, living room spaces, or even dining rooms. I also love to tell people to hang oversized pieces of art in your home. A lot of people love like little gallery walls and things like that, or like small pieces of art. I get it. There's always going to be exceptions to the rule. And I'm not saying that gallery walls are completely out or anything like that. But having an oversized statement piece really draws the eye to the wall. And it can really create this optical illusion of more ceiling height. Now a lot of people have crown molding in their home or are interested in putting in crown molding. Now I do like homes with crown molding and without crown molding. But I would suggest that if you have crown molding or are going to put it in, paint your crown molding the same exact color as your wall. There was a time in design where it was very, very popular to paint your walls a different color than the crown molding. So you would have white crown molding, gray walls, something like that. I would do it all the same color, white or off-white, all the way throughout. And this is going to make your ceiling look even higher.",en,16.63

I went to this protest less than 24 hours ago and have pretty much just been working ever since. Upon getting to the anti-West rally, I was met with actual communists. Welcome back to the Nate Friedman show. Hey, billionaire, is that the enemy? Yeah. The enemy is the billionaire class. Yeah, and why is that? Because the working class, this is all the value in society. Yeah. All that value is extra only for one small class. And because of that, suffering is never going to spread across the entire rest of society. And so what is the organization here with? We tried to put a party of the working class to bring their class into the surface, saying that it is the working class themselves that without their kind permission, nothing runs inside it. No trains run to bring workers to work, no buses run, nothing runs in society without it. So the working class has this much power in society, but how come they don't get to decide what happens in it? Yeah. So what's the most likely with it? Only the billionaire class. Are you working with colleges? We want to connect with all layers, students. In fact, we had a recent fall offensive in our article. We actually reached out to students across the United States. We hit a full campus in New York alone. And we got 2,000 private design ups. That shows the layer of 2,500 sign ups from students. Wow. That shows the youth senses like society is heading into, and is that just in New York? No, of course in the United States. That shows the layer. And it was a Gallup poll, right? The popularity of capitalism fell to 54%. That didn't come out of nowhere, right? Absolutely. The capitalist and their system is making life on the capitalism totally unlivable. I see you have a cafe on, are you going to be here for the protest for Palestine as well? Absolutely, yeah. Do you find that these issues are linked? I've often seen people that are on the Palestine protest that are also pro-communist and do work together at all. It depends on the position and the tactics. We believe that after two years of protest already, it's shown that has anything really changed? Have we stopped funding Israel? Have we stopped sending them weapons and funds? It hasn't stopped yet. But if you look at Italy recently, in this month, in late September, the dock workers have actually struck hit the streets. They blocked all the channels of shipping the arms to those docks and stopped the ships from leaving. All the ships from coming in and offloading the weapons.

A $325 million transformation of the Trinity River into one of the Dallas's most ambitious green spaces is happening right now. The first piece of this is the West Overlook, which consists of 22 acres under construction right now. Four times the site of Clyde Warren Park, by the way. They're going to feature a splash pad, a skate park, a bike park, an interactive playground with a cable ferry and a two-floor cafe, plus a land bridge and a shaded event lawn area too. The numbers on this are going to be a 250 acre park in total. That's nearly 2,000 mature trees and 100,000 plants. This is going to be built to fight against the Dallas Heat Island effects and reconnect residents with the Trinity River too. So you may be wondering, okay great, why does this matter to me? This matters because it's designed by world-renowned Michael van Valkenberger Societs, think Brooklyn Bridge Park and it's expected to generate $2.7 billion in new real estate development and $7 billion in economic impact over the next 30 years. The hopes are that this will serve as a cultural and recreational bridge between downtown Dallas, West Dallas and South Dallas. The completion timeline of this is for West Overlook to be completed in the next three to three and a half years. The goal is that this is set to become Dallas's answer to Central Park, free to the public but designed to feel like a world-class paid attraction.

It's part of our marketing plan. What I try to do is make the appraisal job as easy as possible. I want to make sure they have accurate information so when they get their appraisal together we don't have any outcomes from my seller. So this is part of our marketing package and this right here is my appraisal package. If we actually can't meet I'll email this all to them but if we can meet I'll put a nice little package together like this. And basically this is what's included. So the very first thing is cops. I want to make sure he has good cops that shows and justifies the sales price. Not the list price or sales price because if we've escalated now we have to justify a higher price. So I'll pull all the cops to do that to justify it. The second thing that I like to do is floor plans. Again to give them a whole home story is basically what this is and let them know the layout, the measurements, everything against who they have accurate information. If they have a plot I'll include the plot as well to make sure that they have the outline of the property and know all the dimensions on that as well. And then this here is a copy of the actual MLS listings that I have everything possibly at their fingertips. I'm sure they could get most the information again. It's trying to make it a little easy. And then one of the most important things is I'm gonna have a whole list of all the improvements that have been made to the property from the seller. I don't want them to miss anything. I don't care if it's a do or not as you place through the whole house or what I'm gonna try to get as much value as I can for my seller and this helps justify that. And then the other thing I do is I tell them the story of the property. We had 30 showings in four days. We had seven offers. They escalated. We had 3,000 saves on Zilla, whatever it may be. I want them to see how it's sold after the property or how sold off their property actually is. Again to help push the value as much as I can to justify it for my seller so we're not getting into a situation where we're trying to negotiate with the buyer or having to do any kind of place we're going to be because of the price. And then I also include just for convenience, I'll say if it's an email I'll send them a link with a video and photo that way they can go and like go back if they missed something or forgot something and go back and check it out. And then just part of the actual package here I'll always include like a little bit of short as the fact I touch it off again to help them be a little revived. But this is an appraisal package is what we provide for all our sellers. This is part of our gold package, our base. This is a starter for us but what we try to do is have a plan for everything so we're not coming back to our client and asking them to do any kind of price reduction or even having to renegotiate with the buyer.",en,24.49

So this evening, a man walks into Martin's supermarket in Elkhart, Indiana, and opens fire, ultimately unaliving two people before getting into a shootout with the police, and ultimately that person's life, the shooter's life, is taken as well. Now at this moment, I'm not sure if this person's life was taken by the officers or if he turned the fire on himself. Then regarding the second one, in the early hours of this morning, Monday morning in Amarillo, Texas, there was an apparent argument that broke out, and a man pulled up to a nightclub with a firearm, unloaded it into the crowd, and then fled the scene, ultimately striking nine people. Now of those nine people, one person is dead and eight people are injured, and they have made arrests, arresting a total of three people for this incident.

So let's take a look at how much that would cost. $5.8 trillion dollars. I'll say that again. $5.8 trillion dollars. Now point number two responds to point number one by saying that we're going to impose tariffs to pay for these lower taxes. How much money can we actually make from tariffs? Here you go. $1.5 trillion dollars. That's $4.3 trillion short of covering the cost of his tax cuts. So unless you want to add $4.3 trillion dollars to our national deficit, this plan ain't going to work. Next is to produce more oil to lower energy costs and combat inflation. There are two major problems with this. Number one is that we already produce more oil now than we ever have and it's not affecting prices. So this whole energy costs equals lower prices overall theory can just go straight out the fucking window. And second, inflation is already been solved. Inflation and prices are two entirely different things and our inflation rate is currently 2.9 percent, which is exactly where economists wanted to be. And last on his list is a factually wrong statement that he wants to lower interest rates to reduce costs for businesses and consumers. But the problem is presidents don't control the interest rate.

I am 28 and I'm a loan officer and I have been in the industry since I graduated college. Since 2019, I've noticed a handful of things within this industry. And I think I just want to point them out. It's an industry that I feel like has always been commission based, competitive, slimy at times and just not authentic. I was taught to be polished, professional and fake it till you make it, you know, act like, you know, you're a multimillion dollar producer, fake it until you make it. And I'm not going to sit here and lie about my numbers. I do probably around $10 million in business a year. And this is my third full year doing it all on my own since I've been in the business. And I have gotten to the point where, you know, the numbers I'm doing are good, but I know one that a lot of other people that are doing way better than me aren't as authentic and aren't as educational to their clients. So I know that I can do better. But within the last couple of months, I've shifted my mindset of not being competitive, but being more collaborative with people that are in my industry. I don't need to walk into a room and act like I'm the top sales person, right? There are so many other women out there that are absolutely crushing it in this industry. And when I realized going to them and literally just creating a relationship with them and asking the questions is what's going to help from a competitive standpoint. I think I always want to act like I am the best. But whenever I became self-aware and knocked myself down a couple pegs and realized that just asking and collaborating and not competing and knowing that there's plenty of business to go around, it really changed my mindset. Now, that doesn't mean I don't want to be one of the top. I don't want to be one of the best in my industry. I hope by saying this, I'm manifesting something. But yeah, just ask the questions and connect with people that you want to be like. And yeah, just use them as inspiration.",en,19.73

Unfortunately, this has become all too common where I'm from. I mean, in the last decade, I've seen with my own eyes the city go from a place that's joyful, optimistic, and safe, to a place of sorrow, pessimism, and violence. But what followed was indeed uncommon. It seemed the community had reached its breaking point with accepting children dying of gun violence as normal. And it prompted a very robust and honest discussion, and it forced people to take a very hard look in the mirror and realize how destructive and deadly black culture has become. I've wanted to talk about the cultural epidemic in the black community for a while, and this tragic occurrence in my hometown brought it back to the front of my mind. But even so, I didn't make a video. I was going to discuss it when Carmelo Anthony stabbed and killed Austin Metcalf. But I didn't, because we didn't know the facts, and I didn't want to take part in sensationalizing the murder of a kid and engage in a topic that was racially dividing people. When the whole black fatigue trend was going on, I thought about making a video then, but I didn't, because from all of the videos that I saw about it, everyone covered what I would have said, and I didn't feel as if I could add any unique insight to that. But there was a video that I saw today on X, and it was the straw that broke the camel's back. I usually refrain from harping on the problems within the black culture in an overly pessimistic way, because there's no point. We all know it's true. Even black people know it's true. I can rattle off the common stats, 13% commits 50% of violent crimes, the per capita rate that we're on welfare, the number of children in single-parent households. But that's not important to this video, because we can just assume the premise is correct. The black culture is in a really bad place. I'm a solution-based person, and I've always looked at the cultural problems through a lens of optimism, trying to find opportunities where I can help to improve the situation, rather than just pointing out what's wrong with it. It's like telling a fat person that they're fat, rather than trying to get them in the gym. But with the video I saw today, and just recently, broadly speaking, I've been starting to lose my optimism. That black culture can be saved. That black culture even wants to be saved. Now, as a mixed man who supports Donald Trump, I've heard from every side, the pretentious white liberals, other black people, when was America ever great for black people?

What do you think is important? It's different for everyone. Right.

You know, a lot of like, that's kind of the like some of the newer like ideas that have been infiltrating my screen of just like dusties, you know. And I think that the main message that I get from that is just decentering men, which I think is really important for women, young women to do especially, not relying on men, not, you know, getting in a situation where they're relying on you financially. So I wouldn't be caught dead like, you know, paying for a man for everything. Absolutely not. But, you know, I would be, I think I would be willing to, I think all the girlies are going to hate me for saying this, but I think I would be willing to like kind of have it be a partnership as long as they're trying.

And he's probably going to be boring or old or like controlling or there's no free lunch. So I'm just like, I need to do my own thing. And I just want to follow what makes me feel good to be around. And if paying for somebody, but I want to be around it, then that's fine. But if I don't, if they're not making me feel good or paying for them is not making me feel good, then I'm not going to be around them.

After what Doge discovered the USAID was spending money on, that workforce is expected to go from 10,000 down to 300. Thus today, 1,300 federal employees that work for the CDC were laid off, and the IRS is expected to cut their workforce by 10%.

I'm Sean Fay with Western Europe Metro Robert's Realty to talk about that. Here's the truth, in most cases especially if you didn't set an offer deadline, your first offer is often your best offer. The buyers who move fast are usually serious and motivated. They've likely already seen other homes and are ready to go. When you wait around for something higher, you risk losing that momentum and sometimes the next offer may never come at least as fast as you wanted to. Now that doesn't mean you accept every single first offer. The key is looking at the entire picture, price, terms, financing, motivation of the buyer. So before you pass on that first offer, make sure you talk it through with your agent. Hopefully it's me. It may just be the right move. Want to talk about this further?

Number two, January 2nd of each year, I would sell an additional 4% of my stocks. There's an additional $40,000 of pre-tax income.

So I had someone in my TikTok messenger say that there are apps that do what I do, where you can budget yourself or you can create a savings account yourself. That is absolutely correct. I, however, am here for those people that need individual help or that would like individual help. And what I mean by that is like, I have a client that he was supposed to get a haircut on Saturday and he chose not to and asked him why. And he's like, that's not, it wasn't in the budget. And I'm like, okay, well, looking at everything, you had enough money to get the haircut. So why didn't you get it? And he's like, well, you know, I just changed my mind. And so when it comes to people who are in thousands of dollars of debt, they have this mindset where they shouldn't use any money or they shouldn't do anything for themselves until they get to a certain point. My thing is, is you should never deprive yourself. And I help you personally in that instance and showing you where you can kind of stretch the money or where you can use it. And that's why I, you know, help clients create different buckets of where their finances go. So if you have like a miscellaneous and you're putting money miscellaneous, he had money in there to where he could pay for his haircut. So it's just different things like that, that personal one on one contact that an app can't do. But if you like using an app, I all means go ahead. But if you want someone like myself that can take you from a 500 credit score to a 680 or get you within a certain amount of less debt within 12 months, maybe even six months depending on how everything plays out. So that's just something I do is giving more of that personalized attention to your financial wants and needs and what you're looking for in gaining that extra money back. And are you prepared to retire for the future? Some people at my age of 36 and over still don't have a retirement fund. So that's what I can do for you is help navigate you through those financial waters. So if you're needing assistance, I am still offering that promotion for the fall of $65 for the month that works with your credit score as well as getting you out of debt and budgeting for you.

Frankly, I don't even care that you love each other. Anyone with a pulse in the brain can fall in love, but I had to learn the hard way that love doesn't sustain a relationship. Connection and intimacy and safety and trust do, and those require a lot more than just love, don't they? That's great that you love each other. Here's a better question. Do you respect each other? Does your partner feel respected and valued? Do you even care anymore? Do you work to appreciate each other? Do you serve each other mutually? Can you take accountability when you mess up? Can you repair conflicts together? Can you listen when they say you accidentally hurt them? Can you be vulnerable? Are you a safe place for them to be vulnerable and honest about what they need to feel valued? Because love's not going to be enough. How you love each other is what's going to make the difference. And for those of you who are married, saying I do doesn't mean you can. It just means you want to. And unfortunately, relationship success has nothing to do with your intentions.

Even though they announced a partnership in June on some chips, AMD is announcing a multi-gigawatt partnership with OpenAI to supply AI compute power. So it starts with 1 gigawatt and then it's going to increase up to 6 gigawatt. As a part of that, OpenAI may acquire up to 160 million AMD shares with a 10% stake via warrants. That moves AMD from being a decent GPU play into an AI core infrastructure supplier that threatens Nvidia's dominance. Here's my prediction and insight. This deal lifts AMD, but it has a ripple effect. Nvidia has a strong chance of pulling back or a strong capital could rotate as they reallocate. Broadcom might catch inflows too as chip suppliers get bullish. Watch for both. Nvidia could see profit taken and Broadcom could see rally alongside the AI tailwinds. As always, I'm making all decisions for big returns. Drop in the comments if you'll bet on Nvidia or Broadcom and follow me for live updates on these trades.",en,11.5

So you have to think like if you're getting one every day, which there were a few days in the week that I didn't get one. But still, it's a lot. And then sometimes if I did a specialty, I would add herbal tea and they would add on like a dollar or two. So sometimes it would be eleven to twelve dollars and that just sounds crazy even when I say it. So this is day five. So we're going to see how long we can make it and how much money we save. But it's Monday morning. I'm really, really tired. I did come get me a coffee. But look, this was only four dollars. Okay. And I haven't purchased this in a while. And this is my Duncan order that I shared with y'all. I haven't had it in a while. So hopefully it's still as good as that was when I first had it. And it is. But still, this medium iced coffee, I already bought my feet up. I don't know what you know. It was only four fifty-nine. If I want to get one of these every now and then it's much better than ten to twelve dollars. Anyways, this is day five. So we're going to see how long I can go. I'm going to check back in with y'all. We're going to see how much money we save. So I hope y'all have a great Monday and I will talk to y'all soon.",en,18.52

You have 200 bucks in your account, and you go out to the mall and you spend 150, you've got 50 left. Credit is a little bit the opposite. Credit is an amount that you can get ahead of time that you have to then pay back later. You can spend money that you don't actually have by using credit with the idea that you're going to make that money in the future before you owe it back. But be careful.

I mean, remember, ABC settled with Donald Trump for $15 million, but the thing about dictators is that they take and take and take until there's nothing left to take. You cannot give them an inch because we're seeing it right now. We're seeing exactly why you can't do that.

He said, if ABC thinks this is going to satisfy the regime, they're woefully naive. And look what's happening right now. Donald Trump is still demanding that their license be revoked. Let's take a look at what Colbert had to say. We are all Jimmy Kimmel. I still have a show, though, right? Okay, good. Yesterday, after threats from Trump's FCC chair, ABC yanked Kimmel off the air indefinitely. That is blatant censorship. And it always starts small. You know, remember, like in week one of his presidency, Gulf of America. You call it Gulf of America. Sure, seems harmless, but with an autocrat, you cannot give an inch. And if ABC thinks... If ABC thinks that this is going to satisfy the regime, they are woefully naive. And clearly they've never read the children's book if you give a mouse a Kimmel. Colbert is just so good, but he's exactly right. You cannot give this regime an inch because they will try to take everything from you. If they get a width of weakness that you will not push back on them, this is what happens. Donald Trump rants and rages, demanding that their broadcast licenses be revoked. And let's just be clear. As I said, Donald Trump is not trying to hide his intentions of targeting free speech. Literally yesterday, when he was speaking in front of the Navy, he bragged about how the Associated Press basically cannot cover him anymore. He said, quote, they're almost not allowed to cover me anymore because of that. Take a look. The defense, that Department of War, as I said, we have changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. That was easy. Why are they clapping? That was an easy one. For years I've looked at it and I added it up and I figured we have 92% of the frontage. I say, how can we call it the Gulf of Mexico? I mean, I wouldn't say that Mexico is thrilled with me, but what are you gonna do? It's the Gulf of America. And I love it now. I was watching the other night a report and they said very routinely, in the Gulf of America, this is, they just went on to talk about it. They didn't do it with a smirk or a smile. They didn't say, in the Gulf of America. What the hell? It's called the Gulf of America now and nobody's playing games with it. We got sued by the Associated Press and they lost. In fact, the judge was so good, he said he's calling it the Gulf of America. He's got all the approvals. You have to do that too, to the very liberal Associated Press they got thrown out of court.

Stick around to the end, I'm going to try and keep this under two minutes. So let's talk about Tenacious D and Jack Black and the concert that they did in Sydney recently within the last day or two. It was Kyle Gass or Goss, it was his birthday. So after the concert Jack Black brought out a cake, sung happy birthday to him and then told him to make a wish and on a microphone with cell phones all around people taping this, videoing this, excuse me, I'm going to show my age there. He says his wish was don't miss Trump. Now it would have been bad enough for you to say I wish they didn't miss but what he said was don't miss future tents. He's promoting people to try this again. People that look up to Tenacious D, whoever you are, I used to listen to some of their music. I used to watch Jack Black movies, no more. I will not support Jack Black because he could have spoke up right then and there and said that's not cool man, we're not doing that. That's not cool.

So they were against Maxwell here. But the Justice Department and the Trump administration were likely waiting to see what the Supreme Court did before deciding how to move forward on whether or not to commute Maxwell's sentence to pardon her or to seek any sort of relief for her because she had been cooperating with the Trump administration, met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, etc. And it comes at a very difficult time for this administration. So now the Trump administration may soon decide, well, we may pardon Maxwell, we may commute her sentence, or now they may say, you know what, we have all the leverage in this case now, because Maxwell is facing the possibility of serving likely the rest of her life in this prison facility if she does not receive some type of commutation or pardon. And so the next steps here are the Trump administration will review whether or not she would get a pardon. But even setting that aside, it comes at a critical moment for the Epstein files discussion, because right now on Capitol Hill, there are 217 signatures to release the Epstein files or to force a vote to release the Epstein files. They need 218 signatures. Adelida Grahava, the Congresswoman Elect from Arizona's 7th Congressional District, would be signatory number 218.

The Supreme Court only agrees to ever hear about maybe 100, 120 if they're lucky each term. It's a very small amount. And they only hear cases involving, for example, circuit splits when one circuit disagrees with another circuit. They hear cases of novel issues of law. And actually many legal experts thought that Glaine Maxwell had a somewhat of a decent shot at getting Supreme Court review here because it is a novel issue, whether this non-prosecution agreement in Florida would bar her criminal prosecution in New York. And when the Supreme Court considers cases, it's called a petition for writ of certiorari. The Supreme Court then needs four justices on the court to agree to hear the case. If four justices agree out of the nine, then they'll put it on the docket where they'll discuss the merits of the case. You'll have more briefing. There'll be oral argument in front of the justices as you hear often starting this month. Well here, this morning's orders came out and United States of America versus Glaine Maxwell was on it. That case was decided not to be heard, meaning that four justices on the Supreme Court agreed or did not agree to hear the case. And so it'll never even get to the merits stage. They'll never even discuss whether the merits of the case are sufficient to overturn her conviction. A lot of people were nervous. A lot of people were scared that this could lead to Maxwell walking free from the FPC Bryan facility in Texas.

Just blatantly bragging about media censorship, media coverage that he doesn't like. It's so baffling to me when people still pretend that Donald Trump is not a wannabe dictator. They say, oh, you know, he just has different views than we do. No, no, this is a code red alert. We are in code red mode with what Donald Trump is doing, the attacks on our constitutional rights. And as I mentioned, a major update from the governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, and this connects to the attack on free speech. Late last night as well, he put out this major statement saying this evening, Donald Trump is ordering 400 members of the Texas National Guard for deployment to Illinois, Oregon, and other locations within the United States. No officials from the federal government called me directly to discuss or coordinate. They just did it. Now, as you'll remember, yesterday, or I should say two days ago, a judge in Oregon, appointed by Donald Trump, said that he could not deploy the National Guard to Portland. It was a temporary hold, but Donald Trump essentially tried to find a workaround. And Gavin Newsom responded to this by saying this is a breathtaking abuse of the law and power by the president of the United States. America's on the brink of martial law. Do not be silent. Now, thankfully, there are still some judges out there, still some in the judiciary who care about the Constitution. They care about upholding this document, upholding the rule of law. And that's exactly what happened last night. The judge in the case where Donald Trump was blocked from deploying the guards to Portland called an emergency meeting late on Sunday night, a very rare effort to discuss Donald Trump's deployment of the Texas National Guard, this new order from the administration. She was basically asking like, how is this any different from what he was trying to do a couple of days ago? And thankfully, the judge, again, Trump appointed, granted Oregon and California's motion to block the new call-up of guard troops to Portland. She says this effort to bring California and Texas troops to Oregon is in direct contradiction of her original order. So yeah, I mean, at least a good ruling from the judge for now, Donald Trump for now, can't send National Guardsmen to Portland. And I'm sure this applies to Illinois as well. So there's still some judges out there that will stand up for the rule of law. But the fact that we are here, the fact that number one, Donald Trump's trying to do this in the first place, and number two, trying to circumvent a lawful order from a judge that he appointed is mind-boggling. We are in a very dangerous moment in this country. All of this is incredibly concerning. Whether it be attacking NBC, ABC, demanding their licenses be revoked, or sending the National Guard into blue cities and blue states, the Trump invasion, it's concerning across the board.

Political life flourished with the establishment of the Jewish Agency in 1929, led by figures like Kheim Weitzman and David Ben-Gurion, which coordinated settlement, defense, and diplomacy. The Haganah, a Jewish defense force, emerged to protect communities amid Arab Jewish tensions, especially during the 1929 riots in 1936 and 1939 Arab revolt. Culturally, Hebrew was revived as a spoken language, with schools, newspapers, and theaters fostering a modern Jewish identity. Institutions like the Technion and Hebrew University nurtured scientific and intellectual life. Kibbutzim and Moshevim pioneered collective agriculture, shaping social ideals.

Most drivers completely ignore the gold mines sitting right next to theme parks. First, early morning hotel shuttle runs for guests with dining reservations pay $45 to $60 per trip. While regular drivers make $8 an hour, your banking premium rates before breakfast. Second, late night alcohol delivery to Disney Resort hotels comes with mandatory 25% gratuity built right into the pricing. Third, forgotten item courier services between parks and hotels command $30 to $80 per single delivery. Parents will pay anything to get their kids favorite toy back. Fourth, VIP guest transportation during park closures pays over $120 per hour. When the park shut down, the real money starts flowing.

Now, the big question is, will Cardi double down and continue to fight, or will she backtrack and try to clean up the damage before it gets worse? Either way, this scandal isn't dying down anytime soon. Do you think this could be the controversy that finally ends Cardi's career, or will she find a way to bounce back like she always does? As the firestorm continues, Cardi B is now facing even bigger pressure than before. Legal experts online are weighing in, pointing out that leaking medical documents, even if it was out of anger, could open the door to lawsuits, hippolaws in the U.S. Are extremely strict, and while Cardi isn't a healthcare provider, exposing",en,15.93

A majority of Americans think neither of these candidates are mentally fit. So then that's when you have to compare them based on the substance, based on their record. And that's where Biden has a clear and decisive advantage over Trump. And again, we'll talk about that as well, because Kellyanne kind of walks into a trap, which unfortunately, Bill Maher does not spring on her, but I'm going to. So yeah, it's really important to point that out that Kellyanne Conway is appealing to a double standard. Bill Maher is also correct, too, that the notion of Trump derangement syndrome, it's a lazy shorthand by Trump apologists and Trump cultists to try to downplay or dismiss out of hand any objective or legitimate criticism of Donald Trump. If you criticize Donald Trump, if you think he's stupid or corrupt or narcissistic, you have Trump's range mis syndrome against really reductive and dishonest. Bill Maher is actually correct. Well, listen, by that logic, Trump's range mis syndrome works both ways because there is a cult which excuses downplays or denies or in some ways cheers on when they do acknowledge it. Every deficit that Donald Trump has, and he points out the malignant narcissism and the fact that Trump himself suffers from Trump derangement syndrome, because all you have to do to get into Trump's good graces is to just not criticize him because he has a child's narcissism about him, except of course he's nearly 80 years old and it's a malignant form. So good on Bill Maher for exposing that. In this clip, Kellyanne Conway, again, kind of opens herself up to a really decisive attack from Bill Maher, which never comes. So we're going to play this clip and then I will step in on Bill Maher's behalf. We all have the same bias in hiring. We hire people to do a job who've done the job before. You ask them about their experience. You look at their references. You call people about their work product. We have that bias. And so now people for the first time in centuries or ever have an opportunity to look at two presidents who have served in the job as commander in chief, as president of the United States. And you decide, do I feel more comfortable or better off with one or the other? It's a binary choice. It's very. So what's funny is I'm surprised she makes this argument and I'm surprised Bill Maher didn't pounce on it because it's actually a staggering vulnerability for Kellyanne Conway herself, particularly the part about references. I've used this metaphor before I've used this analogy, which is if you think of your vote, yourself as a voter, if you're an eligible voter, you're effectively a hiring manager or political positions in the United States, right?

They let them live under them in Jizya. They tax them and they let them live and they take that tax and give it back to them. How do you think the Ottoman Empire worked in the last 600 years? How do you think the Golden Age of Isanm lasted for 300 years? So, I just want to make sure I understand. So, they would just take over mostly peaceful? No, most definitely peacefully because that's what they're... Can you show me an example of Jews living peacefully under Islamic rule? Most definitely. Where? When the Hamas had the Israeli captives. The Israeli captives, they killed? They're not killed. There was a nine-month-old baby that just got returned home as a corpse by Hamas. I am interested by what you're saying. So, this is why it's important on this topic to state on the moral domain because all of your numbers are wrong. 65,000 kids have not died. I just say 65,000 kids. I said 65,000 Palestinians and 1.7 million have been displaced creating one of the largest... None of that is correct. And that's okay. It's fraction. I don't believe in the numbers. The point is this. If Israel laid down its weapons, they would be eliminated. No, they would not. You just admitted they would take over Israel. When I say take over, do you? If Hamas laid down their weapons, we would have peace. Most definitely not. The Israelis would keep doing what they have been doing. They have their right to resistance. They have a ceasefire currently, but prior to that... When anyone else in the world... Turn to that body of his name. The emotions of this topic are very high. Obviously, my allegiance is first and foremost to America. I'm interested in it just from a moral standpoint, though. Which is why, as it helped me understand, there are well over 40 Muslim majority countries in the world. Over a billion Muslims. Israel is the size of New Jersey. And it has half the world's jewelry, about 7 million people. Why can't you just let Israel exist and leave it alone? Why the focus? Why the intensity? Why the anger? There's no anger. There's no anger? Not for me. I'm talking about maybe other people. I don't hate anyone. I'm not displeased with anyone. But I don't believe in the unnecessary killing of people. That's not how we were raised. I agree. That's an American Valley and a conservative Valley. I agree. That's why I think October 7th was the beginning of the unraveling of a lot of decency and conflicts. But what do you think about all that spilling over prior? It's the same with the American Revolution. I reject the premise. You reject the premise. I reject the premise. To say that they had no choice but to go in a bunch of babies, let me actually challenge the point. If you were correct and Hamas was trying to resist, why didn't they go attack military targets and instead they attacked civilian targets? That's what terrorists do, right?",en,26.28

Look, Canadians who come to Las Vegas stay longer, they spend more money, and they get out and don't just do things on the Las Vegas Strip. They get out into the other parts of our great state, contributing to our outdoor tourism economy and the small businesses. I want people to know this. We're about to host the HBCU Classic in Las Vegas on October 24th against Gremlin State and Jackson State. It's one of the biggest HBCU classics, and it's going to be played at the Raider Stadium. So despite Donald Trump's infliction of pain on the bad ends in our tourism economy, we are doing everything that we can, and we're resilient to make sure that people know that they're welcome. In fact, Leader Jeffries just appointed me to be a member on the U.S.-Canadian Inter-Parliamentary Group to help restore some of our relationships with our Canadian partners because of how important their role is.

They were here in Colorado. We saw that they got arrested in the night club and stuff. The president of El Salvador, who has the strictest cleanest prisons and who was a country that was being destroyed by the gangs, so he took over, saw an opportunity, reached out to Donald Trump. He said if the guy in Colombia doesn't want him, I'll take him, I'll grow him in my prison with my gang bangers, and I'm not scared that they're gonna get along, and I don't think anybody cares if they don't get along, but there's one thing I want to return. I want to be able to send in everything that we have in our country, and El Salvador, the coffee, anything that they can export into the United States, he said I want to do it with no tariffs. Donald Trump said, I think that's a great idea. It hasn't been fully negotiated yet. But the conversations have started, and they started because the president of El Salvador reached out to Donald Trump when he saw an opportunity. Who was expecting to see that? He's not afraid of putting one scary gang in prison with another one because they control the prisons there. Nobody does what they want. This is not Brad Pitt content, this is just me making dinner.

However, when she returned later that day in the afternoon and saw him still standing there, she decided to call the school to ask about his presence, and that's when she discovered the truth that shocked her. It turned out that the man had volunteered to stand watch over the school just to make sure the children were safe. It's assumed something worrying must have occurred around this time, although reports do not state exactly what that may have been. Nonetheless, this man, who was also a parent himself, took matters into his own hands and sacrificed going to work to stand guard for free. And this kind act truly made the woman's day.

A lot of these—and President Trump was talking about this a little bit—these Arab and Muslim nations don't want this war to be continuing right now, but they also haven't wanted to intervene. And so it seems like Qatar is going to be the key player here. We got a sense of that when we traveled to the Middle East to Qatar with President Trump a few months ago. He wants to deepen ties with the Qataris. And so they are going to be important. They might be the most important people here other than President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu. But again, as Trey was just talking about, the wild card is Hamas and their negotiators and President Trump, while they are so optimistic. He started this press conference today by saying that this could be one of the great days in the history of civilization, but there is a catch. It might not work out.

And apparently her cabinet supplier is a guy named Tommy who lives in South Carolina and she wants me to mail him the cash. Now if you've never mailed thousands of dollars in cash before, don't expect to. FedEx or UPS won't even allow it. So I say I don't think I can mail cash Barb. She says you can mail cash. You just need to put the cash inside of an envelope and seal it at home or in your car before you enter the FedEx office. Just tell them you want to mail a package. That's all. I can mail cash as long as I don't tell them that I'm mailing cash. Sounds totally normal, but Barb wants to know if I've cashed the check. And I want her to know that I'm taking the serious. So I pull out my collection of fake money which looks pretty real unless you hold it under a light. But it should be convincing enough for Barb. I spread out 57 of these on a table and then I take a picture. She says okay, I can't view it clearly here. Can you try to send me a pic to my email? So I send her an email, but not just any email. I make it look like I'm sharing a photo with her through Google Drive and I change the URL to be a redirect URL that will track her IP address if she clicks on it. And she does click on it. And I can see that she's not in Virginia. She's actually in. She says okay, I got the picture. I want you to put the cash inside of an envelope at home and seal it and then locate your nearest FedEx office to mail it overnight next day delivery service and get back to me with a FedEx tracking number to confirm upon receiving it, okay? So she wants me to mail it to this Tommy and I'm able to find out a little bit about this Tommy because he's not doing a very good job of removing his personal data from the data broker lists and people search sites.

But then the story will be over and I'm having way too much fun. So instead I try calling Barb. But of course she doesn't answer. She texts me and she says I'm sorry I'm currently in the hospital where my mom just recovered from coma. I'm here watching her. I said oh my gosh. She said you can have the funds sent out without Tommy's number okay? But I said no they didn't let me. They said I couldn't mail cash. And she probably knew that this might be an issue.

And they say he pulled it off with the help of Nikola Tesla. Hey, someone get this nut job off the internet already. Listen, I'm about to spit a series of pure facts, as I usually do, that support this insane theory. Even I found this one hard to believe at first, and it may not be true, but the evidence was just getting harder and harder to deny. Feel free to fact check any of these and make your own independent decision on what you think. You ready? For real, let me know if any single one of these points is not true. Nikola Tesla was an imaginative inventor in the early 1900s with a keen interest in time travel. That's a fact. According to reports, in 1895 he made a shocking discovery suggesting, not confirming, that time and space could be influenced by magnetic fields. After which he's quoted as saying he could see the past, present, and future all at the same time. When Tesla passed away in 1943, the FBI and Office of Alien Property seized his research and handed it to a team for study, among whom was John G. Trump, Donald Trump's uncle and a well respected electrical engineer at MIT. This all actually happened. John G. Trump claimed Tesla's documents did not include new sound workable principles or methods for realizing any results, which may be trying to downplay what Tesla's work was truly capable of. In 1952, after a US court declared Safa Kasanovich, Nikola Tesla's nephew, the rightful heir to his uncle's estate, Tesla's files and other materials were sent to Serbia, where the nephew lived and they now reside at the Nikola Tesla Museum. But while the FBI originally recorded some 80 trunks of documents among Tesla's work, only 60 trunks arrived in Serbia. Maybe they packed the 80 into 60, but there is the possibility that someone kept the missing documents. So, John G. Trump receives 80 trunks of Tesla's confiscated documents, some of which have never been shown to the public and only 60 are returned. Keep this story in mind, because we barely even grazed a tiff.",en,17.99

He would look at corporate greed, political corruption, and the rising authoritarianism and say, These are the times that try men's souls. Paine would march beside the people, not the powerful. Shouting that Liberty means responsibility. Paine demands truth. Silence in the face of injustice is betrayal. He'd point to those who seek unchecked power and declare, A king has no business in a free country. Thomas Paine would call out hypocrisy. He would demand compassion and remind us That democracy is not inherited. It is defended. Every single day by those brave enough to question, brave enough to vote, and brave enough to act.

I wonder what they'll say when it's their children that are being zip tied I wonder what they'll say when it's them that's being arrested and dragged off without due process I wonder what they'll say then once it hits them and sadly all of this is going to have to hit them before they ever wake up and Understand what's going on and now I says talking about also wanting to have social media surveillance They want to be able to look into our social media accounts and see what everyone is saying so they can arrest people and they will always play it off Like oh, we're going after gang members. We're going after the violent people We're going after the criminals and people will set and give up their rights They'll be okay with it and the very people that said they were gonna You'll go and get my guns when they pry for my cold-ead hands are willing to just hand over so much in the name of we have to own The libs and it's truly disgusting and truly sickening But if you flip this script and you said that a Democratic president was carrying out any of this or Joe Biden or Barack Obama Or Gavin Newsom or whoever comes down the line next if any of them ever done this You would hear complete outrage and you would see good old boys taken to the streets then You would absolutely see them going for it then if it was a Democrat carrying this stuff out But they never stop and think about you know what right now We're giving this tyrant full control and we're going out here and we're joining up with us so we can be tyrants too We're gonna flex and we're gonna show everybody how much muscle we have they may be enjoying that right now But eventually the tide will turn you'll see a Democratic president again and that Democratic president can have a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House and They could end up getting the Supreme Court flip back in their favor and then they could just right back and reap pure hell on Appalachians and hey, they got immunity So see when we sit here and we try to bring these points across It's not to try to have a gotcha moment It's not to try to one up somebody or own a political party or win a political argument. It's just about common sense It's about trying to get people to see the rights as they've been willing to throw away All because they wanted to go after a neighbor that they disliked or a person's lifestyle",en,22.88

And if we wait until then, it's going to be too late to get ahead of it. So let's check the scorecard. We already know the housing market is in a terrible place. Insumer confidence is at its lowest point since 2021. The key group of economists in Atlanta are now predicting the economy could contract by as much as 3% in Q1. That would be the worst since the last time Trump was president. Now his industry breaking tariffs are about to hit American businesses who import from Canada and Mexico. So far, it's been too early to see any material damage in the numbers. That's about the change. Because on Thursday and Friday, we're going to get a private and a public jobs report that show exactly how bad it's getting. Now they won't tell the whole story because a lot of the jobs data was collected before the biggest layoffs. I do think we're going to see some cracks. And if it's really bad, we might find out that it only took Trump one month to break both of Biden's best streaks. 48 consecutive months of job growth and 16 consecutive quarters of GDP growth. GDP growth that I might add was expected to be strong as little as a few weeks ago. But after Trump just told us in January that we were at the beginning of a great, beautiful, golden age of business, saying the exact opposite, people said the economy was their number one issue.

At 75, his wife decided she could no longer stay silent. Her words were calm but powerful, and what she admitted left people in disbelief. For decades, she had been seen as the strong, graceful woman behind one of the most respected pastors in America. But now, she was revealing something that made even her most loyal supporters stop and question everything they thought they knew. You won't believe what she confessed after carrying it inside for so long. From the outside, the Evans family seemed like a perfect example of faith and unity. Dr. Tony Evans was admired everywhere. He was not just a pastor, he was a voice, a teacher, and a man who had inspired millions. His church, Oakcliff Bible Fellowship, had grown from a small living room group into one of the biggest and most powerful ministries in the country. People said his sermons could touch hearts and change lives. His books were read across the world, and his radio program reached homes far beyond America. To many, he represented strength, wisdom, and faith at its finest. But behind that success, there was another story quietly unfolding, one that few dared to talk about.

The first outer rectangle is 30 feet tall and has water running over the side. The inner rectangle is another 20 feet drop, leading down to a pool of about 18 inches of water. This 33 year old first flung himself over the first 30 feet drop, causing a head wound and leaving a blood trail in the water. That's when all workers noticed and started to record him. He can then be seen lying on his stomach looking into the second rectangle before sliding in and falling head first for another 20 feet. Luckily he survived and was rushed to the hospital with only a broken leg. When he was being rescued by the firefighters, he said to one of the men that he did this for his father.

And I'm not saying that that's not what happened, what I'm about to share with you, but look. So this story just broke that her family said that she has died by self-unaliving. But what's really strange about this is there was a few weeks ago, a doctor said that she was going to be dead in four days, according to her because of a bus accident. But that didn't really happen, or wasn't exactly right, just some very weird things regarding Virginia Guffrey in the last few weeks. And now all of a sudden she is no longer living. We don't have a lot of details as to what happened. And we might not ever really know because that's very personal, very private.

The AFD has been growing fast and in some states they're on track to win majorities in local elections. Now, in just the past two weeks in one state, North Rhine, Westphalia, seven AFD candidates running for office have died. And because the German government has been trying to ban the party, they fire state workers who belong to the party and they're labeling members as right wing, it looks like a series of hits were made to ensure that they didn't come to power. As some of you know, I was one of the co-founders of the organization that later became the AFD and I'm still involved. So I've been up all night researching and talking with people. So here's the facts about what's going on that I got. Seven AFD candidates passed away, all in different towns. Police say there's no sign of foul play. The cases are spread out, not connected. Here are their locations and ages, a 59-year-old in Rheinberg in Wesen, a 71-year-old in Schwerth in Una. One was 66 years old from Blomberg in Lippe.

How many people do you think that on the Holocaust? How many people do you think died on the Holocaust? There's I get so many different 78 million is usually the number They made million I've seen six. I've seen two I've seen three okay So what number do you believe and why does it matter did I live back then? That's 1940 1940s? Does it matter no? I mean regardless? It's a massive killing of them, but I don't know how I'm real how yeah, of course Oh, then it should how can you say they haven't repopulated to those times? How do you know what they're again record of the death? Yeah, there is a record of the death And so we know how many Jews that there were in the country and in Europe and they have not yet been able to repopulate to those Same equivalent numbers coming back. So I look I think we don't agree on anything and that's okay I would love to see an end to the killing however there needs to be three let me to ask you my three-part question Okay, do you believe anti-Semitism is real wrong and evil? I believe it is wrong and I believe it exists I believe it's evil. Okay good, but it's right to exist. It's a super easy three-point question It's not a semi The term come about well a semi yes comes from somebody from the Samaritan region. Yes, I'm at a people's which right I could have finished the you know answer But yes from the Samaritan region that is a term that has largely been popularized in the last 1500 So let me let me be more specific anti-Jewish hatred. Is that fair? Yes? That's that's evil wrong Yes, okay, Israel's a right to exist. Yes. Yes, okay good And that since we posit that Israel has a right to exist that we need to come up with some solution Or all people could live peacefully Okay, or a one-state solution or a three-state solution, right? Okay, then why can't it if it's a one-state solution? Why can't they live in a Palestinian peaceful like they did previously?

Put that issue at the top. Think of four more for me. Okay. Think back to what Donald Trump and MAGA has done on those five issues and see how close they come to fixing those five things. And I guarantee you they didn't fix a one of them. So if you're sitting over here looking at some Democrat going, Well, they've not really said enough. They've not really said enough to please me on these five things. Well, look over at the ones who had the chance to do it and didn't.

Let's talk about why Snapchat will be more than a social media app and the chart looks very bullish right now. Snapchat stock is down 23% this year, but I smell an opportunity. Snapchat is more than just Snapchat. It's AR, it's AI, it's advertising, it's now subscriptions all in one stack. In quarter two, they hit 932 million monthly active users, which is up 7% from the previous years. And daily active users has hit 469 million. So Snapchat also turned the corner. They're operating cashflow with 88 million in Q2 and Qt free cashflow, I apologize, is 24 million. They're reducing losses gradually and strengthening their balance sheet, finally. Not only that, but Snap's sponsored snaps, which are ads in chat, are gaining huge traction. They've shown conversions lift up 22% in these campaigns. There are other non-ad revenue, which includes Snapchat plus, which is subscription, grew 64% year over year. Think about now, instead of someone starting in only fans, they just make people pay for their Snapchat. Snap is doubling down on their small and medium business, advertising a segment with a ton of room to grow. Let's talk about their AR and VR. So Snap plans to launch consumer AI glasses in 2026. We've seen how big meta glasses are, which by the way, spoiler alert, I think meta should buy Snapchat, which would make this absolutely fly. And they already have a huge AR lens creator ecosystem with 350 million daily users who engage with their AR. And they have over 400,000 developers building these lenses. Okay, catalyst number four. Analysts have finally started to re-rate the stock. So for a while, people have been very, very bearish on Snapchat, they've been giving it price targets, downgrades, all sorts of stuff. Many people have moved the consensus to fair value, which is higher than Snapchat's current price, I might add. And if they maintain their growth and margin expansion, we should see price target upgrades coming. So obviously there's some risks and some counterpoints of course. Their revenue growth slowed a bit in Q2. It was their slowest I've noticed in quite a while. And of course they're still unprofitable. They've always been unprofitable. In my opinion, they always will be unprofitable, which is why they need to sell. This would be a perfect, perfect acquisition for meta. So it's Snapchat can nail their monetization, scale their AR, their specs vision, all that kind of stuff. Their margins keep improving, the bullishness is huge. Now let's talk about the, y'all know I love my daily W's. Look at this absolutely beautiful fricking daily chart. Clear X point at the top there, clear A point, clear B point right at the golden pocket, and right at the 200 EMA and 200 MA. Chef's kiss, came back down, made our C point at the 236 fib, and now we're moving up. Once we get past 870, expect to move to $9 over that 920, over that 10, y'all can see it, man. The levels are here. Let's get after it. I absolutely love Snapchat long-term. I am in 20, 28 calls and shares.",en,27.24

I just wanted to ask if you had any advice on how I can pursue and maintain a God-centered marriage for the rest of my life. Well, and thank you for that. Number one, God must always come first from your spiritual disciplines. Honor the Sabbaths and turn off your phone for one day a week. Go to a church, a good Bible-based church. We have many of the pastors here that teach the word of God verse by verse, and also understand that it's external things of the flesh like alcohol or porn or drugs or other temptations that will take down your marriage. You as the husband must constantly be at guard of things, and also over shopping, over indulgence, too much credit cards, idolatry of vacations. You must guard the family from those things seeping in. So understand the order. It's God and then the marriage, and those things will bless your marriage from the devil who tries to undermine it and usurp your holy union. I love it. Thank you, Charlie. God bless you, man.

They believe in spiritual warfare and they're constantly on a shame, feel worthless, get rescued cycle all day, every day, multiple times a day.

I hope I have earned the trust enough of the people to believe me when I say that I have verified this information but cannot reveal the source. Tyler Robinson is not suicidal. The entire narrative that was placed in the media about him having been suicidal is completely fictional as are many other aspects of what we have been told. His father having, quote, turned him in after a confession is also complete fiction. To the contrary, Tyler Robinson maintains his innocence and has never even been to the UVU campus. There are absolutely zero photos or video that the campus can produce to the contrary, which is why they have produced nothing other than a blurry image, which Tyler's family knows is not him. Tyler has never once expressed a suicidal thought. I want to make that clear. The federal government is lying about absolutely everything other than the fact that it is his gun. Not that we needed further substantiation, but Tyler Robinson did not author those discord messages. I would like to again stress that he has never been to UVU campus, but and I need to confirm this later. I believe he was around the campus on that day. I will have more on this later, but I wanted to immediately publish that the Tyler Robinson suicide narrative plus the quote dad that did the right thing after realizing his son was guilty is a federal concoction.

He was stabbed in the chest and 18 year old is recovering after being stabbed in the arm. In fact, one Pace student who was leaving the dining hall walked right into the crime scene just after it happened, seeing a bloody pair of pliers and a blood covered sharp stick in the street which may have been murder weapons. All the cops started coming down John Street from Broadway and there was a lot of commotion. They started yelling for us to get out of the way and I guess somebody got stabbed with pliers or a wooden stick. It was pretty chaotic. I got a lot of videos of it. Cops were pushing people out of the way trying to secure the scene and there was a lot of blood. There was a big trail across different parts of John Street. Right now the NYPD's crime scene unit is parked right in front of that Pace University door. The victim who died was only 17 years old. We don't know if he was a Pace student, no word on who this young man was or why he was attacked, but he becomes the fourth homicide victim in the NYPD's first precinct this year.

Lisa Heilman lives in Sanford and says she has the same problem with the Samsung stainless steel refrigerator. All of this ice has built up even throughout the back. And when she started researching online, she found post after post with the exact same complaint. Heilman says she's surprised there isn't a recall of some sort on these ice makers. Ridiculous. Or at least a lasting fix.

Across Portland and Chicago, violent protests are reigniting debates over law enforcement and federal intervention. While Democratic leaders like Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Oregon's Attorney General say there's no need for military troops and that their cities are not war zones, federal officials paint a very different picture. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says officers are facing daily violence, protesters allegedly threatening families, attacking ICE agents, and even placing bounties on law enforcement officers' heads, with reports of $10,000 offers to kill agents and $2,000 to kidnap them. Noem claims gangs, cartels and foreign terrorist groups are behind the threats and possibly funding organized protests pointing to identical gear and printed signs among demonstrators. She says ICE and Border Patrol officers have been cornered and attacked in cities like Chicago while local leaders deny the violence. Critics accuse these leaders of downplaying the chaos while Noem insists her teams are removing dangerous criminals and restoring order.

Like, I mean, in your opinion, I mean, obviously you're not in their brains, but why did they let Jolani speak in America? Like, does that show that we're weak and we're allowing this to happen? Therefore, our vulnerabilities can be exploited or is there a tactic to it? Or, you know, could we be the CIA track him and bug him and they're trying to find a way to get him in so we can, you know, for his opportunity to do this? Like, what are your thoughts on that? Yeah, there's two pieces. There's a political piece and then like you're kind of bringing up an operational piece. The political piece is very, very simple. There's a strong effort for kind of a Middle East peace plan, maybe leading into some sort of something like a Nobel Peace Prize. And there's a belief they need to bring Jolani, who's now the president of Syria since he took over the country with a bunch of terrorists last year, they need him for this peace plan. So that's the political piece. Now, unfortunately on the operational side, our Department of Defense is allied with Jolani and they're taking out targets for him. Unfortunately, they're selling it to the American people as, hey, we're doing these effective operations against ISIS and they're not just this year. Two times they said they killed the head of ISIS, he's still alive. So they think they're taking out targets, but they're not and they fell for the same rules. Unfortunately, in Afghanistan, where we're partnered with the Taliban. So it's kind of, we're just watching the exact same thing that happened in Afghanistan happened again. Do you think it's intentional or do you think it's incompetence? Like is the President Trump and our forces or CIA and the people that can do all the dirty work and should have technology to understand all of these things? How can we continue to get bamboozled? I think a little bit hubris, nobody wants to admit they are falling for terrorist propaganda. I think there's a lot of people in our government, even within our Congress, that wanted to see some sort of peace in Syria. So almost like forcing it, even though he's already committed just this year genocide against Christians, genocide against Alawites. This is a guy who actually is one of the lead people who imprisoned and made all those Yazidi women be ISIS brides and they raped them, kidnapped them. We saw the public displays where they sold them, right? So yeah, it's like a watch for something. Like everybody wants like these bad guys to become good like us and they can't understand.

At the center of that transformation is something new. The XRPL permissioned DEX, often called Ripple's private decentralized exchange. The XRP ledger has always had a built-in decentralized exchange, one of the first in blockchain history. But this new version is different. It's designed for banks, fintechs, and regulated entities that need the speed and efficiency of blockchain, but with privacy, compliance, and control. Instead of an open public marketplace, the permissioned DEX introduces the idea of permissioned domains. Each domain is like a private trading floor inside the ledger. Only verified accounts can place or accept offers there. To gain access, participants hold a digital credential, a cryptographic proof that they've passed KYC or other compliance checks without ever exposing their personal information on chain. These permissioned order books are isolated from the public DEX. That means trades within them stay within a trusted network of verified users, while still settling directly on the XRP ledger, instantly, transparently, and without intermediaries. This hybrid design gives institutions the best of both worlds, blockchain efficiency with real-world accountability. Ripple calls it the bridge between decentralized finance and traditional finance. The technology behind it is already live in parts. On-chain credentials have been activated, and permissioned domains can be created on XRPL test networks today. Ripple and partners like SBI Group are exploring pilot use cases, setting the stage for fully regulated digital asset markets on XRPL. It's not just a new exchange. It's a new model for compliance-ready DeFi, where liquidity moves freely. But access is controlled, a private decentralized exchange built for the institutional era, fast verified, and ready for the future of finance. ChatGPT can make mistakes.

There's a growing theory that the financial system we've all been operating under, one dominated by the Federal Reserve, central banks, and Fiat currency manipulation, is a design to keep the masses enslaved and in debt while consolidating power amongst a select few. If Trump's goal is to dismantle that system and usher in a new financial structure backed by real assets such as gold, silver, blockchain based solutions, then allowing the old system to implode makes sense. Think about it. The debt based economy is unsustainable. We've printed trillions out of thin air, inflated markets beyond recognition, and now we're sitting on a ticking time bomb. The only way that we can truly shift to a new financial paradigm is to let the old one fail. If Trump and his administration are working behind the scenes to transition to a gold backed or a blockchain integrated monetary system, then crashing the markets would be the perfect way to accelerate the shift while exposing the corruption and fraud within the traditional banking system. The question becomes, how do they ensure that the collapse is controlled and doesn't leave the everyday person completely destitute? That's where concepts like asset tokenization, decentralized finance, and a potential debt reset come into play. Whether through an ASAR or a DASAR or some other restructuring mechanism, we can see a planned demolition of the fiat system in favor of something more transparent, accountable, and fair. Of course, tick-tock, this is all speculative, but the signs are there. Your financial institutions are quietly moving towards blockchain adoption, central banks are testing digital currencies, and gold is being reintroduced in discussions about monetary policies. So whether Trump is the orchestrator or just playing his role in a much larger plan remains to be unseen. What's undeniable is that the massive financial shift is underway, and those who aren't prepared can be caught off guard.

So I'll listen to an article how Charlotte represented of asking that the National Guard come to Charlotte. Even though Charlotte's had a abundance of murders and crime in the last past month, do you agree that the National Guard should come to Charlotte? I don't think so. I think we're blowing things out of proportion and we're trying to keep up with the Joneses. Charlotte has crime. However, I really think that we should have more of a police presence. However, check out this video and tell me what you think. Again, don't forget to subscribe. U-R-A-S-S-I-P-F-I. Charlotte, on the National Stage, could the National Guard come to Charlotte and do city leaders think it's needed? Well, the Charlotte Mecklenburg Fraternal Order of Police has sent a letter to city leaders, the governor and even the president asking for the National Guard to be deployed to Charlotte. WBTV's Katie Salt joins us now live. They didn't know you spoke with city council members about this letter. What are they telling you? Well, right now, city leaders on both sides of the aisle tell me they don't feel the National Guard is needed. Instead, they say the focus needs to be on staffing public safety and the city with more police officers. We have been working with the White House, our federal officers and assistants and all of us that we want to do. We definitely want to be sure that we are taking the right steps forward. But the Charmec FOP wants the National Guard in the mix. In a letter shared to social media Friday morning, the FOP writes, quote, this request is due to the ongoing failure of city and police leadership to address the severe staffing crisis within the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department, which we believe has led to a violence crisis in Charlotte, end quote. Something council members don't necessarily agree with. I think we need to be focused here in Charlotte and be able to block out the outside noise. No, we don't need the National Guard in Charlotte. No one wants to see the National Guard come to Charlotte, but you can never take it off the table. I think that that was meant for some shock value to a certain degree, and I like that they're bringing the attention to crime. That is the issue in Charlotte and we have a crime problem. Do you think it's needed? National Guard. I don't think that there's been a real clear plan as to what they would do in first coordinating with CMPD. Peacock and Graham say the bigger focus needs to be on CMPD staffing and making officers more visible, both on public transit and throughout the city. We're asking if someone calls 911, who's going to respond, is it going to be CMPD or PSS? Obviously, it could be a combination of the two. But again, I'm welcoming the visibility. We want to see people know that the message is if you ride, you must pay. If you're up to something illegal, we're going to identify you. Yeah, I'm committed to giving CMPD all the resources that they need to have to ensure that our city is protected and safe. I support it in increasing the salary.",en,25.4

Number two, in 1979 the tax rate for the richest people in America, the highest tax bracket tax rate was 70%. By 1988 it was 28%. Last year Jeff Bezos paid about 1.1% in taxes on his increased wealth.",en,10.7

They didn't just push your buttons, they triggered a gate in the spiritual realm that they had no power to shut once it opened. It's like they unknowingly pressed a divine emergency button, and what came through wasn't just protection, it was judgment. They thought they were just messing with you. They didn't realize you were spiritually sealed, and sealed souls are connected to realms that don't play about them. They assumed you were just another person they could manipulate or destroy behind closed doors. What they didn't realize was, you had a spiritual covenant they couldn't see, one that came with serious consequences for anyone who crossed the line. And when they tested your spirit, they didn't just meet resistance, they triggered ancestral alarms, angelic responses and divine order. You didn't need to defend yourself because heaven had already picked up the case before you said a word. That's when things started shifting in their lives and they couldn't explain it. Relationships started crumbling, money stopped flowing, plans that used to succeed started collapsing for no reason. It wasn't a curse, it was the aftermath of violating spiritual protocol. They messed with someone chosen, someone covered. The gate they opened wasn't theirs to control and they had no clue what they were up against. What they meant for harm became their own downfall, and you didn't even have to lift a hand. That's how rank works. See, spiritual rank doesn't brag but it moves with force when tested. The protection over your life isn't passive, it's reactive. It waits silently until danger shows up and then it responds without asking you for permission. They underestimated the cost of testing a consecrated soul. They thought you were just lucky or spiritually harmless. But the second they crossed that line, they were met with power that silences mouths, shuts doors and exposes motives. Now they're dealing with consequences they can't reverse. And they're too ashamed to admit they caused it by targeting the wrong one. You didn't have to curse them, you just had to stay in alignment. The spiritual gate took care of the rest and they learned the hard way that some doors once opened lead straight to divine correction.",en,17.26

It examines ethical, legal, economic, and societal consequences before the system is deployed. The goal? Spot risks, understand them, and figure out how to reduce the bad stuff before it happens. For example, if a hiring AI might discriminate, the impact assessment reveals the issue early so that it can be fixed. In governance, this tool ensures AI systems are tested like crash dummies for cars. Risks exposed before real people get hurt. Impact assessments are AI's report cards.

Do you think that if you have a very good idea of what the ideal relationship would look like for you, you have a higher chance of getting that into your life? Because everybody wants to experience something and what you're looking for is also looking for you. It's just that most people, they don't have the belief in themselves that they can get it.

Los expertos alertan que esto podría ser solo el comienzo, las largas sesiones de juego no solo afectarían el cráneo, sino también el estómago, las palmas y la postura general del cuerpo.

The princess is her solo tour of child-focused institutions. She met with staff at the Ely and Carow Children's Centre in Cardiff. Catherine added a full-length Massimo Duttycoat to her closet in 2020. A classic camelcoat is a wardrobe staple, providing an effortlessly chic. Catherine wore a black wool polo neck and a zara-pleated leopard print mid-length skirt under underneath the cashmere outerwear. A pair of black pointed boots and matching gold jewellery were her only accessories. November arrived with a chill in 2022, and Catherine embraced it fully during her visit to the street, a community hub in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, on the 3rd, accompanied by Prince William. The couple was there to spotlight local initiatives tackling cost of living pressures and social isolation, a cause close to their hearts amid the ongoing economic strains. Catherine channelled pure autumnal sophistication in head-to-toe camel, starting with the star of the show, a minimalist max and co-long-run wool coat in a soft, slouchy silhouette crafted from 100% wool, featuring a lapel collar, slip pockets, and a self-tie belt left languidly unnotted for an air of relaxed chic.

Let me break this down because it's going to change everything if this happens. XRP wouldn't just be a crypto anymore. It would become a national infrastructure. We're talking about the US using XRP as a bridge for CBD, Cs, main transfers, real-world assets, everything. And to move trillions of dollars daily through XRP, the price would need to explode. Not to five dollars, or ten dollars, but thousands, maybe even tens of thousands were token. That's how liquidity scales. Not by volume, but by value or token. They don't want retail holding it. That's why we've been suppressed, fought, married. But if the US takes control, XRP becomes regulated, legitimized, and fricking unstoppable. This is bigger than crypto. Bigger than hype.

So this past weekend I went to Miami of all places With my mentors and we went to all these different places. We went to lunch We went to the gym We ended up going to dinner and what I noticed was that in these circles and in these groups I was sitting at tables with people who are making six to seven figures a month Yeah, a month and that just got me thinking like damn me four years ago was broke I literally had like two dollars in my bank account. I was completely unhealthy. I was depressed crying every single day I was unfit like I Didn't have that. I had no ass like no self-confidence and now I'm sitting at a table with people who are making six to seven figures a month Who are living the dream their dream life who are in shape and who have purpose and fulfillment? And I got me thinking like damn like none of these people that I'm sitting with are complaining about the economy Are talking about how hard it is to get ahead and that's what I finally realized like this is this economy is not the problem Right, we're in a mindset problem If anything, it's easier than ever to be successful these days. So it's not that the world is getting harder It's that mindsets are getting softer So anybody has the power to do what I did Anybody has the power to just change their mindset and change their environment because what I also realized was I'm sitting at These tables not as the girl that I was four years ago But I have room for a seat at this table because I am one of these people So if you can start to just take ownership of your actions of your habits of your mindset and control your thoughts and actually take Action towards your goals. That's how you become successful So if you're just stuck waiting for the right time waiting for the economy to look up to make that investment Waiting for the perfect moment.

Behind the calm, wise smile and the decades of unforgettable performances lies a story of loss, pain and personal struggle. From health battles to the challenges that time brings, Freeman's journey has taken a heartbreaking turn. Fans worldwide are shocked, heartbroken and searching for answers. This is more than a story of fame. It's the human side of a legend confronting life's cruel realities. Morgan Freeman's story begins in the quiet heat of Memphis, Tennessee, on June 4, 1937, as the youngest of five children born into a world that gave very little and demanded a lot. His parents, struggling to make ends meet, worked tirelessly. His mother scrubbing floors and serving as a nurse's aide, his father trying to keep a small barber shop afloat. Tony was scarce and the hunger was constant. Freeman would later recall nights when the emptiness in his stomach felt heavier than the blanket on his back. Nights when silence and scarcity became his closest companions. Life offered no guarantees and security was a fragile illusion. At a young age, Morgan was left behind in Charleston, Mississippi, in the care of his grandmother, while his parents moved north in search of opportunity. The house where he lived was a mix of refuge and shelter.",en,14.51

A mother in Texas took the life of her four-year-old daughter out of jealousy towards this happy little girl and stuffed her into the trunk of her car. 25-year-old Stacey Marie Parsons walked into the police station at 9 a.m. on Monday and told the police that she had killed her four-year-old daughter Victoria Wyatt. When the police rushed to the suspect's home, they found Victoria in the trunk of a car without breathing. The forensic report shows injuries to both the head and chest. Investigators believe that the woman drove to a bridge about five miles away and committed this horrific crime, then drove the car back home and walked to the police station. Gary Wyatt, her husband who lived with her for six years, said he told the woman on Sunday night that he wanted a divorce, which sparked a heated argument between them. The next morning when he woke up, Parsons and little Victoria were no longer there. He thought they had gone to kindergarten, but when Parsons returned home and they tried to talk to her, she just said with a gloomy face, if I were you, I wouldn't be in that car. The family immediately ran to the car and found Victoria in the trunk, wrapped in a garbage bag. They tried to save her, but were unsuccessful. Gary told the police that his wife resents Victoria and her own children. Parsons once said to Gary, I would rather kill Victoria and spend the rest of my life in prison than endure you. Parsons has been sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. But is this really fair to young Victoria?",en,13.85

These are our new digital dollars. But stablecoins are not crypto. They're just digital representations of the US dollar, which has already lost 97% of its purchasing power. That means your dollar today is worth about three pennies from what it used to be. When they flip this system, those stablecoins are going to unpeg from the old US dollar and they're going to repeg it to whatever new gold silverback dollar we've got coming in this new system. That's when the exchange rate hits. You cannot trade a dollar worth three pennies evenly for a dollar worth 100 pennies.

Now, clearly that's not true, but if you're wondering why he used that specific word, insurrectionists, it's because in court, he needs to satisfy one of three justifications to be able to deploy the military domestically. Those thresholds are an invasion by a foreign nation, an inability to execute the laws with the existing law enforcement authorities, and finally, a rebellion or insurrection. So he's playing make-believe right now in an effort to, I don't know, manifest into reality his desire for there to actually be an insurrection so that he can retroactively justify his illegal troop deployment in Portland. Now, here's what's important about that. Trump has used that excuse of rebellion or insurrection in every city he's deployed the troops into, and in every city, judges ruled against him. Judge Breyer ruled against him in this bogus justification in California. Judge Imragot, who Trump himself appointed, ruled against this bogus justification in Oregon. And of course, Trump is gonna use the same justification in Chicago, which is all but assured to get the same reaction from judges there. So while Trump may try and use these very basic rhetorical schemes to trick his own supporters, it's not working in the courtrooms where it actually matters, where he actually needs evidence to back up his claims.",en,33.34

Cause I think it's important that you mention what drew you into it. And, you know, I personally have been very critical of the Democrats saying, you know, for too long they ignored the border issue. I don't know, you guys may not know this about me. I'm also, I just retired, but I was a pilot in the Air National Guard and we actually flew the border in Arizona. And we would go down there. I think we were based out of Tucson and we'd fly the border. And, you know, you'd see, we'd find bodies all the time. You know, we were reconnaissance plane. We'd find bodies, coyotes would bring these people over and then desert them. And, you know, Arizona's not like just one big industrial area. Right. It's a lot of desert. A lot of areas people get lost in diets, human trafficking. And I think that's an important point is what drew you in was Donald Trump took legitimate grievances that people have and put voice to it. But then what you then experienced is this in practice is not about like, hey, let's just get rid of the criminals. Let's control the border. Now it's rolled into racial profiling. And the interesting thing about this is, so you talk about, you know, the SUVs and everything. I mean, you didn't know they were police, right? You didn't know they were law enforcement. Probably even when they started talking to you, but that's got to be a little frightening, right? Absolutely.

And the scariest part? He's not the only one. More and more gamers are shaving their heads and finding the same dents. And even big streamer Tim the Tatman posted a photo, his head shape almost completely deformed. But here's the real question. Could this just be the beginning? Scientists warn it's not only the skull. Long gaming hours could also reshape your stomach and hands. Are we actually evolving into a new kind of human? Or is this the curse of technology addiction?

This link contained an article regarding Zana. Within the article, it described Zana having bruises as well as that she put up a fight. After his mother sent that text message, he did not reply to her until the next day. Then the next text message between the two has to do with coffee beans. Brian Coburger's mother then sent him a second text. She said, quote, yes, still there, same girl. She then continues by saying, quote, very sweet, the two older customers there.

If they do not discuss those with you and explain that those play a factor in helping buyers get homes with homeowners insurance, passing inspections, they do not discuss that. Please do not hire them hire a different realtor because I'm noticing realtors are listing homes with roofs that are 14 and 15 years old and per insurance you have to have four to five years life left.

Every naturalized citizen knows this. They all know it's, it is one of the penalties. And so, yes, so if you lose your citizenship, then yes, you can be deported. And you have to be deported because you don't have a citizen citizenship. Remember, she was a citizen of Somalia. She came over as a war refugee. Her father was on the losing side of a coup there. And she comes to the United States. And there's a lot of documentary evidence about something very strange going on with a man who, and remember, these stories about, you know, we make the, you know, the jokes about the brother stuff. Those stories originally came from the Somali community in Minnesota. There were, you know, there were blogs and rumors, and this all came up and said, well, wait a minute, you know, there's different naming conventions. They have tribal naming conventions, which are different than sort of like the Western, you know, first name, last name that we're used to in the US. And so people are coming up and saying, wait a minute, this guy doesn't have the same last name. But actually, if you understand the naming convention, he is her brother. And here's this marriage document. And, you know, again, a lot of these questions, a lot of this needs to get investigated. And here you have the USCIS director saying we found rampant fraud in immigration, specifically marriage fraud. And everyone, everyone knows, of course, that, you know, that marriage is, you know, the green card marriage, you know, this is something that's rampant because it is a put you on the fast track citizenship. Let me let me let me ask you, Jack, what do you think happens in this country if they do denaturalize and deport Ilhan Omar, meaning she is expelled from Congress, citizenship revoked, then sent back to Somalia? What's the left? What's the left reaction? I mean, they're going to freak out, they would be probably on the tarmac trying to stop the plane from taking off. I think I think that's the kind of political moment that that could ignite a powder keg. And it could. Absolutely. I mean, we already have powder kegs. I mean, I know they're going off. You know, they they asked me, they said, you know, do you think CNN asked me, do you think we're in a civil war? And I said, well, look what they just did to Charlie.

Later that day, she went to the school to pay the fee, and she was transferred to the principal's office. We know the name of the woman with the paddle.

Now let's break it down and I'll show you guys what. Today we only traded one stock which is SPRB and we're up $80.35 on it. We took two trades and our account value is now at $831.49 which is insane. The stock popped up on my scanner and I saw it was surging super high. And then I looked on the 15 second chart and saw that we had a brief pullback and I saw it hit a new high right here and I bought it on this candle. This candle then surged with a low of $12 to a high of $18.45. So I sold out somewhere around a $15.70 point and took about $90 a profit on this candle. At market open at $9.30 I saw this candle struck a surge up and I bought it. So then the candle sold off and became red as you see. And then I sold out and lost about $10-$13 a profit. That showed me that I really need to stick to my strategy and not just buy out of impulse. Overall today was a great day. I'm up $80 on the day making my account go into the $800. And I also want to let you guys know that I now have stickers up on the TikTok shop. Just trading related stickers. There's no brand or anything.

Matt Damon is the brilliant mind behind Goodwill Hunting, the fearless Jason Bourne, who rewrote the rules of action cinema, the soldier in saving Private Ryan, who carried the sorrow of an entire generation, and the commanding figure in Oppenheimer, who gave history a human face. With every film, he turned pain into strength, wounds into triumph, and discipline into art, a man who stood among legends yet shown brighter than them all. But even legends know blood and tears. Behind that dazzling light lie wounds few could ever endure, the unbearable pain of losing those he loved most, the years of pushing his body beyond its limits for art, and the silent moments of darkness when the applause had faded.

Joining us right now is Congresswoman Stephen Horstford of Nevada. Congressmen glad to have you here. Republicans have spent a lot of time trying to brand this shutdown. It's been all about the Democrats, but polling data shows that they are the ones who are bearing the brunt of the heat for this shutdown. It's theirs. They have to own it. 100%. The Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House. They control the votes in determining whether or not their budget could pass. They knew that they did not have the votes. In fact, their own budget got fewer votes than the Democratic alternative when it went to the Senate. I'm starting to think that this is more about Speaker Johnson wanting to protect Donald Trump from the full release of Epstein's files than he is about protecting the American people and our right to affordable health care. Leader Jeffries and House Democrats have called three specific things. Cancel the cuts, the Medicaid and Medicare. Lower cost on middle-class families and safe health care. Nothing more, nothing less. And that is what we are fighting for in this moment, not just what we're fighting against. Also, we talk about fighting in this moment. You're also fighting misinformation. You're fighting people. I'm listening to some of these people. I saw a clip last night. I'm gonna play it in a second. Stephen A. Smith was on the Sears X and Radio Show talking about how, well, inflation is not as bad as it used to be and we haven't really feeling it and how the economy has in crater. And I'm like, what the hell are you talking about? Donald Trump was ahead. Two consecutive awful months of job growth. Biden Harris didn't have one in 48 months. You also look at inflation higher today than it was a year ago, higher than it was last month. Meat prices up. We used to talk about a housing issue. So I'm like, what role are you living in? Well, as you know, I represent Las Vegas and we are confronted with what's called the Trump Flump right now. And since the beginning of this year, tourism has been down double digits.

On that stage, Ivanka Trump mocked Jasmine Crockett, trying to paint her as an outsider. The room grew tense, uncertain, but Jasmine didn't raise her voice. She didn't lose her composure. Instead, she asked one question, just one, that left the entire room speechless. The studio is alive with energy. Bright lights beam down from above, bouncing off the polished desk in the center of the stage. Cameras sweep across the room, catching the eager faces of the live audience. People are leaning forward in their seats, whispering to each other, waiting for the moment the show truly begins. On one side of the table sits Ivanka Trump. Her posture is perfect, her smile practiced, her presence calm. She carries herself with the quiet confidence of someone who has spent years in the spotlight. Dressed in a sharp outfit, she looks every bit the image of power and polish. On the other side sits Jasmine Crockett, a rising political voice, determined, outspoken, and unapologetically herself. She doesn't wear the same guarded smile. Instead, her expression is steady, her eyes alert, her hands resting calmly in front of her.

But gradually, Stephanie felt that something was wrong. Indeed, her husband first started becoming very distant from her. He would often be absent during the night and only return home the next day without telling her what he had really been doing. Then, it was her daughter's turn to distance herself from her. When this happened, Stephanie was very sad and when she asked them what was wrong, Pierre and Celia would say that everything was fine and that she shouldn't worry. However, Stephanie still had strong doubts about horrible acts her husband might have committed. So, to make sure and get to the bottom of it, she installed cameras throughout the house to see what he was really doing with their little daughter Celia.

It all began with whispers in the industry, but then videos and screenshots started circulating. Some fans claimed that she had gotten a little too close to someone else, while others refused to believe it. Papooz, being the man he was,",en,11.58

For decades, King Charles and Queen Camilla have fought to protect their love story from scandal, whispers, and doubt. But now, a shocking revelation from within the family threatens to undo it all. Princess Beatrice, once considered a quiet and loyal royal, has uncovered and exposed an alleged agreement between Camilla and her father. The truth, long hidden in palace corridors, has left King Charles in tears. What was this secret packed, and why would Beatrice risk everything to reveal it now? Today, we uncover the story shaking the monarchy's very core. A family built on secrets. The Great Halls of Buckingham Palace carry centuries of whispers, but some secrets are not etched into stone or sealed within archives. They live in glances, in carefully chosen words, in the way silence fills a room when certain names are spoken. The House of Windsor has always balanced its duty with private truths, truths that sometimes threaten to erupt into the open. In the midst of this fragile balance stands Princess Beatrice, a woman who has long lived in the shadow of her father's mistakes and her grandmother's enduring legacy. To the world she is the quieter cousin, dutiful but discreet, rarely the subject of scandal. Yet even the quietest voices can one day speak words that echo through the walls of history. For King Charles, secrecy has always been both a shield and a shield.",en,14.67

Assuming it was just another friendly neighbor or perhaps a deliveryman, he went to open it. But as soon as Andreas opened it, he only heard, this is for you, mate, and was splashed in the face with battery acid. He says immediately he knew it was acid and ran through his house screaming for his wife to call 911, as he tried to find the kitchen where he would begin dousing his face with tap water.

Should there be some type of scheduled layoffs to maybe entice Democrats to come to the table, like every hour another agency, another hundred pink slips? I'm sure Russ Vote has a list of folks ready to go. Well look, the Office of Management and Budget, as we've said repeatedly, is working with the agencies and our cabinet secretaries to identify where cuts unfortunately can and have to be made. If the government is restored to funding and back in operation, will that list of potential layoffs still be on the table? Look, as I just stated, the Office of Management and Budget is in constant communication and contact right now with our cabinet secretaries and agencies across the board to identify, unfortunately, where layoffs have to be made and where cuts have to happen. You've argued that these impending layoffs are necessary to keep essential services up and running, but that has never been the case in any previous shutdown. You know when the government was shut down for 35 days in Trump's first term, you've never had to lay off thousands of workers to keep essential services up and running. So why are layoffs now necessary in this shutdown? Because we have an administration and we have a president who are wholeheartedly focused on restoring fiscal sanity to our government and doing the right thing by the American taxpayer. We are $37 trillion in debt and the federal government is currently shut down. There is no more money coming into the federal government's coffers. And as you've also seen since the beginning in January, this administration is focusing on waste, fraud, and abuse. And so Democrats have given this administration an unenviable choice to have to take a look at the balance sheet and identify where these cuts in layoffs can be made. And you just said this is an unenviable choice, that this is an unfortunate consequence. But the President has described this as an unprecedented opportunity to lay off additional workers. He's posted a video likening Rustvo to the Grim Reaper. So which is this? Is this an opportunity to fire more workers or an unfortunate consequence? Look, the President likes to have a little fun every now and then and I think both things can be true at the same time. The Democrats have given the administration this opportunity and we don't like laying people off. Nobody takes joy in that around here. And if you think that, then I think that's very sad. You view the White House and our staff as wanting to put people out of work. Nobody wants to do that, but sometimes in government you have to make tough decisions.",en,20.23

I've said for months now that we're likely going to see the stock market crash in 2025 and that we're likely going to see the economy go into a recession in 2025. But I believe that Trump's policies are going to be good for our country. When you talk about the stock market, there's something called micro and macro. Micro means short term, macro means long term. I think that Trump's policies are going to be very good for the long term. But he inherited something from Biden that you can't fix without causing some pain in the short term. We did so much damage with Bidenomics. There really is no way with the size of inflation we went through, where interest rates are out right now, the yield inversion, all the different things we have going on in our economy. There is no way to go through and fix what we are dealing with without going through some pains. So while I'm saying yes, you're likely going to see the market shaken up by this a bit. And yes, I think we're going into a recession. I do think there's going to be a lot of good that comes from this. And I think it's going to help all of us in the long run.

Lesson number one is always make sure you pay yourself first. When that paycheck hits make sure you automatically send money into your savings account. Even if it's just $25 just make sure you build a habit of saving before spending. Number two is understanding the true cost of debt especially with credit cards. Because baby one thing that I've learned on this journey is that credit card interest compounds daily and what that means is that you pay interest on top of interest and that is some bullshit. And the third thing is to start investing early even if it's small amount. Because trust me the future you will be happy that the younger you did it early and earned all of that compound interest along the way. And remember if you're learning this later in life it's not too late to start. Hope you're doing well.,en,11.1

So let's talk about what these roles involve and how you can set yourself up for success. Hi, my name is Dr. April Baraj. I'm a labor economist where I make innovation tech in the economy clear accessible and attainable. Big data specialists. These are problem solvers who take messy information, right? And they make sense of it. So they help businesses answer questions like, hmm, which customers are most likely to leave? Or where are we losing money in our supply chain? So if you're in high school, focus on math, statistic courses, and computer science. Join clubs where you handle data, robotics, debate, even science fairs. In college, if you're in college, think of majors like data science, computer science, or applied mathematics. The key is to graduate with projects that prove you can turn raw data into useful insights. So number two, we have fintech engineers. These are the people building the software behind digital money. So things like mobile payment apps, blockchain systems, or fraud detection tools. They merge finance and coding to create safer, faster, and cheaper ways to move money. As a student, take both economics and computer science courses, join investment clubs, blockchain groups, or hackathons. Look for internships with banks or fintech startups. By graduation, you want to show you can explain both how money works and how software runs behind the scenes. And number three, we have AI machine learning experts. These specialists essentially design algorithms that let computers learn from existing data. They create things like recommendation system, chatbots, or models that help doctors fight diseases. As a student, build a strong math-based, linear algebra, probability and statistics. Learn Python and join research projects or labs that use these real-world data sets. Aim to finish at least one project where you train an AI model and explain what it does in very simple terms. For students, the winning formula is courses, plus clubs, plus projects, and internships. Stack those in your graduate position for the fastest-growing careers of 2030. Let me know what you all think about this. Thanks so much.",en,20.05

A bipartisan bill called the Patients Before Monopolies Act was just dropped by Elizabeth Warren and Josh Hawley. Now, these are two senators that are often butting heads, so when they team up, people listen. Plus, there's now a matching bill in the House as well. And what they're going after are the three big companies that control 80% of the PBMs, which is your pharmacy benefit managers in America. That's UnitedHealth Group, CVS Caremark, and Cygnus Express Scripts. And what this bill would do is it would force these companies to choose either you can manage prescription benefits or you can be a health insurance company, but you can't be both. And if it passes, it would require these companies to sell off their PBMs within three years. So what does this mean for you guys? Well, when an insurance company controls not only the insurance side, but also the pharmacy side, it means that they can also help dictate the cost of those medications and what medications you could actually get. Think about it this way. Imagine you lived in a town, there was only one grocery store, but that grocery store also owned the farm. They could dictate everything, but this is just on a much larger scale. And here's the thing. It seems to be gaining steam with both sides of the aisle. So whether or not it passes, we'll still be up in the air. Make sure to call your legislators and your center, say that you support them passing the Patients Before Monopolies Act.",en,14.59

For those of you who are new, Heaven grew up with a single mom who had a job as a nurse and when she went to work she would often drop Heaven and her sister off at the house of a woman she was very close to to play with their kids. This man was that woman's husband and also Heaven's mother's landlord. And on this particular day he was left alone with the kids and Heaven and her sister because his wife had an appointment. He then separated Heaven from the other kids, brutally assayed her and poured sand down her mouth so she would stop screaming. By the time he was done her entire womb was damaged and her backbone was cracked to the point where you could see it sticking out of her skin. He then unalived her by strangling her, washed the blood off her body, bathed her in bleach, dressed her back up and threw her outside to make it look like she fell. And to make his story more believable he took a razor blade and made cuts into her body. His older daughter helped clean up, his younger daughter ran to his aunt's house to tell her that Heaven fell even though it was a lie. And his wife who was apparently so close to Heaven's mother is completely defending him and beating up anyone who questions his innocence. But Heaven's mother knew something was wrong right when she saw her. I mean she's a literal nurse and that's her daughter so she immediately called authorities but almost all of them refused to help until one that did. But she was immediately told that she would lose her job if she continued. Initially the man spent three days in jail but then the case was closed and he was let out and he immediately threatened Heaven's mother and even sent people after her to kill her to the point where they had to relocate. They then reopened the case and sentenced him to 25 years but no he will likely get parole or get the entire thing appealed. This is cause his brother is affiliated with police and he has connections outside that can and will hurt Heaven's mother if she pursues a case against him. It's also been alleged that that man had feelings for Heaven's mother but those feelings were not reciprocated and he did this as a revenge plot. We need to protect Heaven's mother be a voice for her and Heaven, question the Ethiopian government, sign this petition, not stop saying her name and fight.",en,21.47

In the comment here, we see one. In a previous video related to this comment that was left, I said the left wing just bases their entire ideology on memes. Spruce Jay says, oh, the left has done it. Have you seen what the president posts? This logical fallacy is a classic what aboutism. Not only does it fail to address the claim or even try to disprove it, what it does is shift the burden of the blame from the left wing to someone else completely unrelated, in this case, the sitting president of the United States. The obvious logical flaw in this is that your behavior is not dependent on someone else's behavior. You are responsible for you. So for example, if I'm speeding and weaving through traffic and the passenger in my car says, dude, you're driving like a maniac slow down, and I say, well, what about all these other people? They're not driving well. They're speeding and weaving too. That's not a counter argument. Their bad behavior does not excuse my bad behavior, nor does it validate it. I am responsible for my own bad behavior, which means if I am breaking the law, if I'm driving recklessly, if I'm speeding and weaving through traffic, it is my responsibility and solely my responsibility to change my behavior. This is actually something very similar you see in Destiny's video too, where he was challenged to stop with the inflammatory violent rhetoric. He says, well, look at the president's post. Look at what he posts on X and true search on Yaya. I'll tone it down when he tones it down and he got excoriated for that. Justfully so. Like rightfully so. He is responsible for his own behavior. The president is responsible for his. So when I say you need to stop basing your ideology on memes and 10 second little out of context clips and you need to actually be the responsible party and go delve deep into the subjects and go get the actual context of what's being discussed. You need to do that. You need to stop pointing your fingers at other people. Oh, what about him? What about the president? What about that person over there? What about Destiny? What about Ben Shapiro? What about all these other? They don't matter. You matter. Your behavior matters. responsibility for your own actions.",en,21.4

So back at it now though. So I'll show you guys this one. We are wrapping this project up this week. Obviously a lot has happened in 30 days. You see we've got the paint job done, shutters up, mailbox up, house numbers up. Still got a couple lights to hang. Hardwood floor's got done over the weekend so I'll just do a quick run through on this but you guys check it out. So still got a little bit of cleanup to do in the yard. Probably got to take down that basketball post there and one of the neighbors was kind of up to leave me a tire. We'll get that. See what else we're missing here. I need to put some extensions on the gutters. Obviously we've got a little bit of landscaping to do. Ran out of cedar on this shutter here so we'll just slide in a piece of one by three there. Got the house numbers on. Light needs to be hung there. Like I said, hardwoods do get done this weekend. They are dry. I hate to walk on them but we're going to. So entry lights up, ceiling fan, dining room light. We are missing our stairwell light. Plants are in. Back splash is done. Obviously when the hardwood gets done everybody just kind of throws everything into the kitchen here. Bedroom one. Looks good. Trim guys will be back tomorrow to put in shoe mold and painter will be here wrapping everything up. Bedroom two. Missing a fan. Bedroom three. This is our finished hall bath. Got this, I think this is a mixture of tile shop tile I believe. Vanity Home Depot. Of course mirror and lights Home Depot. Good size den area. And then master is pretty big as well. So really big actually. Of course we installed the egress window. Nice master closet. Locked door. And then master bath. Looks like electricity is not quite done there also.

They did not give her enough money dealing with all the stuff she dealt with, plus on top of that, the value of the home. I doubt that they gave her that. Holly has come to terms with the reality now. So she's parting way with everything before the dozers move in. All the lighting fixtures had pendant lighting here. I've sold toilets. I have sold garage doors. Literally everything. Siding, gutters, everything's for sale. The living room furniture already sold, so the patio chairs moved inside. Today, they're tearing down the deck. Make me a moderately small reasonable offer, and it is absolutely yours to take and go home with. If a person has to sell the screws, the wood, the siding, the doors, the trim, the roof, if they have to sell all of these things, the chances that you pay them enough money for the home is probably slim. That's just my guess. From what she's doing, she probably did not get all of the money that she needed. Who does that? If you guys believe that's the city, that the builder, that whoever is going to give you the amount of money that you need to fix the issue, these insurance companies, how many times have we understood that you have to put you and your family first before any of this? And if you put your loyalty into trusting these companies, our individuals who you believe are gonna have your best interest, your best interest at heart, at the forefront, you're crazy.

In this episode, we explore the stock market and how it can help build your financial future. Join us as we delve into the essentials of investing guided by Rebecca Marie Stockwell. The stock market is where shares of companies are bought and sold. Investing means owning a small part of a business. As companies grow, so can your investment. Think of it as planting a financial seed for future growth. The stock market operates through exchanges like the NYSE and NASDAQ. Indexes such as the S&P 500 measure performance, stock prices are influenced by data and emotions, confidence, fear, and hope drive the market. The stock market impacts your retirement accounts, pensions, and job market. When markets grow, companies hire more and pay better. Conversely, market downturns can lead to cost cutting and reduced hiring. To start investing, educate yourself on financial basics. Set clear goals, create a realistic budget, and diversify your portfolio. Think long term. Patience is key to building wealth. Investing involves buying and holding stocks for long term growth, while trading focuses on short term gains. Investing offers stability and the benefits of compounding over time. Conscious spending and saving are crucial. Spend wisely by differentiating needs from wants. Save consistently, track expenses, and plan for retirement. Avoid debt and pay off credit cards monthly. Building a financially free future means having control, peace of mind, and opportunity. Wealth is built through discipline, patience, and consistency. Start small, but start. Every wise choice counts. Financial literacy equals empowerment. The stock market may fluctuate, but your consistency matters more. Your future is worth every wise decision. Keep learning, saving, and investing in your beautiful life.",en,17.84

I'm a wife I don't want to be on my phone 24 seven So I think just having that time management and figuring out what works best for me has helped Tremendously and I think it can really help you so I do batch content so what that means is I just make a lot of videos in a short amount of time and Then I just keep them in my drafts and post them throughout the week or Whatever or like a couple of days and To do that what I like to do is I have like a little basket of things that I want to post content on and I use things and I try things before I post about them because I think that's really important. I obviously Want to monetize on here, but I only want to like promote things that I genuinely feel like work So Anyways, so I try the product to make sure that I like it and then go from there so I Create the batching content by setting a timer So I'll have a basket of things I want to do and I just had a basket there I said I'm for 45 minutes.

First the owner goes to the state government to get a corporation charter and permit to sell shares in this business. Next our friend goes to an investment banker and shows him the record of the oil drum manufacturing companies past performance and plans for expansion. The investment banker decides to help our friend sell shares in the corporation to raise the three million dollars.

Now, and also let's go back a few months when Trump announced his tariffs. Now, as you might remember, we issued tariffs on China to over 100%. Depending on goods, I've heard from anywhere to like 240-something percent. Well, China was one of the biggest importers of our soybeans. And obviously in retaliation, can't say I blame them. China decided to stop buying soybeans from the United States. Why would they want to when they'd have to pay almost double now because of these tariffs? Now, let's skip a little bit. Trump wanted to bail out Argentina with a $20 billion line of credit. Funny how we don't have money for healthcare for American citizens, but we can give Argentina $20 billion. And all because Argentina's leader is pro-Trump. I think that's the only reason Trump is doing it because he's one of the few guys that likes him. Now, right after Trump agreed to that bailout, which I believe still needs approval, guess who decided to sell a bunch of their soybeans to China? Argentina. So we want to bail out a country that is going to screw us over by selling their soybeans at a much lower price to China. Who is Trump really protecting? Come on, people. I never thought I'd have to talk about soybeans, but here we are. This is just an example how self-serving Trump is at the cost of American farmers.

Like I don't want any of these women to get abortions. You gotta stop killing everybody. It is always fascinating to me how the left likes to use edge cases as opposed to the mainstream case. So the young girl who gets raped, and she's gonna have to now bear the baby, that is not nearly the vast majority of abortions in this country. They're using edge cases because even if you said to them, okay, well, we will say that you can have abortions in these cases, they would say, but yes, but what we actually want is just abortion across the board for all time for any reason whatsoever. I need your money to kill babies by abortion. So those edge cases are just an excuse for them to get the policy they actually want. They won't argue on the core policy because it's just too ugly for them. They don't like that core policy. But again, reality matters not to these people. The only thing that matters to them is that they're very, very angry because they like abortion an awful lot. Just heard the news about Roe v. Wade and we in the Jewish community are horrified. I know. There's a huge problem for us, all of us in the Jewish community because we as a religion support abortion. Nope. If someone needs an abortion because their baby is sick, they're allowed to do it according to Jewish law. No. If being pregnant is causing a tremendous amount of stress for the mother, then according to Jewish law, she is allowed to have an abortion. No. So to all of you out there that are outraged by this, we as a Jewish community, we support you. Nope. Hey, Agudah Israel, which is an Orthodox group, came out with a statement of support for the overruling of Roe v. Wade. Rabbi J. David Blech, who is one of the founders of sort of bio-ethics in the Orthodox Jewish community, had an article talking about why the overruling of Roe v. Wade was good. The very best you can say is maybe what the Orthodox Union said, they put in a very milk toast statement, suggesting that they couldn't either mourn or support because Jewish law is nuanced on these issues. But the nuance in Jewish law completely disregards the idea from the left that abortion on demand is an inherent good. Jewish law says that if you want an abortion, you have to go to a rabbi, part of the patriarchy, and you have to get a hetero, meaning some sort of permission, in order to get the abortion. And only the most permissive authorities, you're talking about fringe permissive authorities, allow abortions in some of the kinds of cases she's talking about. And there are certain rabbanim ranging from Moshe Feinstein to Rob Joseph Soloveitchek, who say that it is equivalent to murder. So no, I mean, this is just wrong. And the attempt to turn Judaism into a pro-abortion religion is ridiculous. At the best, you can say that Judaism is more nuanced than Catholicism, but it is in no way pro-choice religion by any stretch of the imagination. This is bigger than just wanting to have an abortion whenever you want. And if you think it isn't, you're the problem. This is bigger than your political views, than your religious views. This is about the woman who tried to have a baby so bad and ended up having a miscarriage who now has to go stand on trial. This is about the woman who was raped or incest or just doesn't want to have a baby because she's not ready because she's not... Ah, that was...",en,29.1

Hundreds of people wounded, 50, 55 people shot and killed. And Tritsky gets up and says, what a wonderful place it is. They need help. Meanwhile, this happening after a local district judge in Oregon yesterday blocked, blocked the president's National Guard deployment to Portland. Judge Karen Emmergut, ruling this is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law, she said, granting a restraining order preventing Trump from mobilizing the Oregon National Guard to assist federal agents in Portland. So yes, once again, a local district court judge thinking she can just overrule the commander in chief. Sorry, Mr. President, but you don't have the authority. You got to go through me first. A bit odd considering the president commands the armed forces, not some local district court judge. And just a quick refresher of what's happening in the city of Portland. This was last night. Last night outside the ICE detention center in downtown Portland, DHS forced to deploy black hawks over the facility, working with their sniper nests on top of the building to prevent any breach of federal property. Look, these aren't organic protests, folks. These are what are known as paid agitators. Many of these people are the same people because we recognize them, the same people that you see all over the country, they're flown in, trained, funded, bused in. They go from city to city. They follow these large ICE deployments around. These people, again, they are trained, funded, and Kristi Noem's had enough, she says. The Trump administration writ large has had enough. They've been trained to form these tight formations, jumping locals just walking down the street. Just walking down the street, they jump these people and they do it on purpose in an effort to distract the federal officers. That's what they're saying, that these Border Patrol agents will see someone being jumped outside their ICE detention facility. So the Border Patrol agent runs over to help, leaving their posts unattended, which allow these rioters, other rioters standing by, to penetrate that newly created weak point at the facility and local police, local law enforcement, nowhere to be seen. Once again in Portland, they've been ordered to stand down, not assist these federal officers, hence why Trump's trying to deploy the National Guard, to give ICE the backup that they need to do their job safely. This morning, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem explaining just how bad, how dangerous ICE's job has gotten. Watch what she said.",en,22.23

I can tell you, things like that are just too bad. I appointed the judge and he goes like that. So I wasn't served well, obviously. I don't know the judge. But if he made that kind of a decision, Portland is turning to the ground. You have agitators, insurrectionists, all you have to do is look at them, look at them, look at the television, turn on your television, read your news papers. It's turning to the ground. The governor, the mayor, the politicians are petrified for their lives. Right. It's always somebody else's fault. Oh, I was giving misinformation. Judge Embergut is a quality candidate, a quality judge. She's been a state prosecutor, a federal prosecutor in California and in Oregon. She's worked for the Department of Justice. She's been a U.S. attorney. She's been a county district attorney. She's been it all. She's the kind of judge you want in that chair, whether you're Democrat or Republican. But that's not good enough. So as she was going into the hearing last night, I'm sure the words of Stephen Miller was ringing in her ear, where he called her effectively an insurrectionist. Here's what Stephen Miller had to say about the judge before she had the hearing. She said, the president is the committee, this is Miller, the president is the commander in chief of the armed forces, not an Oregon judge. Portland and Oregon law enforcement, at the direction of local leaders, have refused to aid ICE officers facing relentless terrorist assault. That's a lie and threats to life. None of that is going on in Oregon. This is an organized terrorist attack, I guess led by the judge. The judge is now a terrorist on the federal government and its officers. And the deployment of troops is an absolute necessity to defend our personnel and for the republic itself. So now the judge is an insurrectionist and a terrorist.",en,28.23

Which gave us this great mugshot, and he's charged with a number of things, including felony kidnapping. Well, he had called 911 when he first had that encounter with them to call the police to come get the illegals, and we now have some of that 911 tape. Okay, tell me exactly what happened. Well, I got this Mexican here, and he doesn't have a driver's license. Are you? Okay, is he driving or just walking around? Or what's going on that he doesn't have a driver's license? He's driving. He doesn't have a driver's license. Yeah, he's illegal. Madness. But in that same news broadcast, we did find out some other information about what's going on with his case. Man captured on video taunting a man in his truck on Sullivan's Island was given bond in court tonight. Yeah, he bonded out. His family came to the hearing and told the presiding judge that he tried to get help for mental health and alcohol issues, but needed to continue with therapy because mental health issues and alcoholism cause you to be racist, apparently. That's funny. I've known a bunch of people who have struggled with both of those things, and none of them went full racist and tried to hold human beings against their will and have them deported. But that same news broadcast did have another very interesting additional piece of information. Sullivan's Island Police Department says after continuing its investigation into that viral video, they obtained warrants charging Johnson with two more counts of kidnapping. Johnson then turned himself in again this afternoon and was taken back to the Charleston County Jail. That's right. He was arrested again as this article puts it, racist rancher charged with kidnapping again. Because the police reviewed the video and realized there wasn't just one person in that truck. I guess there were three people in that truck and they'd only charged him with one count of kidnapping. So they hit him with two more felony counts of kidnapping. And then like right after he had just gotten out, they're like, hey, we have to re-arrest you. You got to come back in. And he had to turn himself back in and we got a new mug shot out of it. So now I believe he's facing three felonies. He did bond out again, but you could say he's going through it.

I did a little bit of research. They are responsible for about 1% of the annual global copper hall, which is not very much, especially when you consider that they're responsible for almost 4% of the annual global total gold hall. So it's small, but they really just, I say just started in mining terms. They just started back in 2011 when they acquired equinox minerals. That's really when copper became a second priority to them, you know, in addition to gold. And it's smart because there's a supply deficit coming in copper. And there's not many companies out there exploring for it or growing production of it. Copper is already in an upward trajectory. When we hit a supply deficit, we're definitely going to start seeing wild moves in that metal. With gold and silver already sort of flashing this commodity rally, inflation favors commodities a weaker dollar, which is caused by inflation, which is caused by lower interest rates. Also favor commodities. Copper is a commodity. We've already got lots of exposure to gold and silver. We'll talk more about that later too. Copper is another one. And commodities, honestly, hard assets are really looking like they're coming up in a cycle. And we've sort of got a battle of growth versus value here, where a growth cycle is sort of coming to an end, and a value cycle is coming up. We've got global economies in basically pre-war mode here, where they're building up their militaries. And they're building up their arsenals and their stockpiling critical supplies. Copper is a critical supply. It is essential also to the energy transition, which a lot of people would tell you is over, is at least slowed down. In 2024, the world spent $1 trillion on the energy transition. So far in 2025, we've spent $2 trillion. It's not slowing down. It's not stopping. The world is definitely expanding its energy options. Like we said a long time ago, it's going to be kaleidoscopic. We're going to need all of the energy we can to support the global growth that we're expecting and that we want. Copper is going to play a huge role in that. Copper prices actually shot up today, the day that we're filming, because Freeport McMoran, another big copper producer, is facing shutdowns at Strasburg Mine, which is one of its biggest copper mines. So you're going to see wild moves in the price of copper. Barrick is going to sort of track those. It's going to follow gold more, obviously, because that's a bigger part of it. But I like both the gold and the copper. I like commodities. And I think everybody needs to be invested. And I think Barrick is a really good place to be there. It was up a good 30% last month. So I think it's safe to say that we can get, we've got the momentum behind us for October here. Barrick Mining Corporation. Now this used to be Barrick Gold. And its ticker symbol used to be G-O-L-D, but it's not anymore. It's just B, because they want everybody to know that they are more than just a one-trick pony.",en,27.77

Tan says one missed paycheck is enough to strain families. That will add a tremendous amount of people that will temporarily need our services even if they didn't need them prior to the shutdown.

And the study followed them from 1992 to 2019. Out of the original 321 Palestinians, 204 ended up being convicted of a crime, 71 of them were jailed, and 176 ended up on welfare. So that accounts for 63% became criminals and were convicted, and more than half ended up on welfare. So they followed the second generation. They had 999 children, 337 ended up being convicted of a crime, 132 of them ended up being jailed, and 372 of them ended up on welfare. So that's a 34% conviction rate and a 37% welfare rate.

Charleston White shook the entire internet when he stood up for David, the rising music star accused in one of the darkest and most confusing cases of the year. When reports broke that a dismembered body had been found inside a Tesla registered to David, the world instantly lost its mind. News outlets rushed to label him guilty. Social media exploded with theories and brands started cutting ties overnight. Everyone was convinced this was an open and shut case. Everyone except Charleston White. So think about this. If they got all this information on him dating a minor, an undaid's kid and she looked like a white girl mixed girl, what they let just stay free like this? Known for his wild mouth and unfiltered takes, Charleston came out swinging declaring David is innocent. And he claimed to have proof that flipped everything upside down. Charleston didn't just make noise. He came with a point that hit hard. He argued that in America, young black men get arrested for way less every single day. So if police really had solid proof, David would already be behind bars. No question. They arrest brothers for crumbs of evidence. He said, reminding everyone that the system never hesitates when it comes to locking up young black men. So you mean to tell me OJ was found with a bloody glove? He was arrested immediately. It's me without a circumstance of evidence they found on OJ. They placed it. So you mean to tell me they got all this on this and he still get the mood freely amongst America? To Charleston, the fact that David was still free meant one thing. There was no real case. He even compared it to the OJ Simpson trial, saying this situation made no sense. If someone really had been killed and hidden in a celebrity's car, how could there be no arrest after all that? Something he said was not adding up. But Charleston didn't stop there. He went deep into the rumors that David had been involved with a teenage girl whose death had rocked the Internet. Fans had been posting supposed evidence matching tattoos, leaked photos, even song lyrics they claimed were confessions. The Internet was buzzing with speculation, but Charleston called it all too neat. So I'm saying, let me think outside the box. Maybe his mama done it. Maybe her mama done it.",en,21.78

Many retirees use the 4% rule, or even 3% for safety. Step 3. Keep some money invested so it continues to grow and fight inflation. Finally, have backup options.

WCNC's Charlotte Jesse Pierre is live outside of the Mecklenburg County Courthouse in uptown where that hearing took place. Jesse, you were able to speak to Tate's family today. We appreciate their time, but what do they tell you? Well, yes, that's right. I did speak to Tate's family briefly here at the courthouse and at their home and they say Tate is innocent. I also got a chance to speak to some folks that live in the area where the incident happened and they say the accusations are alarming. It's pretty disturbing that it's so close to home. Latwain Tate, also known as Miss Sharon in court Wednesday, charged with two counts of statutory rape, six counts of indecent liberties with a minor and one count of statutory sex offense. Police say there are at least four victims, boys, between the ages of 14 and 15. After weeks long investigation, Tate was arrested Tuesday. My wife told me I was in the house. She told me that there were cops outside, a lot of undercover cops. Investigators say several of the boys stayed with Tate and performed sexual acts on Tate at the home. Folks who live in the area say the entire ordeal is unsettling. 14, 15 year olds can be so impressionable at that age and to think that somebody would take advantage of kids in that age range, that's just very alarming. Mary Catherine Elkins with Pat's Place Child Advocacy Center says they work with CMPD on investigations like this. We provide a forensic interview, which is a developmentally appropriate conversation with children to get information from them that's admissible in court. Elkins says it is important for parents to have regular conversations with their kids about safety and appropriate relationships with adults. Even with teenagers, they need to be aware that there are boundaries and that they can say no. Now police believe there may be more victims out there and asking anyone with information to come forward. Tate's next court hearing is scheduled for October 16.

I told you from the beginning that Trump was lying about Doge, this department of government efficiency that he was supposedly going to create by executive order. I told you that was alive from the beginning because presidents don't have authority to create departments of government. That has to be done by Congress and presidents have no authority to cut anything out of the federal budget or to cut government spending or government programs at all because that's what Donald Trump said he was going to be doing with his Doge department. He was going to cut $2 trillion out of the federal budget and he was tasking Elon Musk with that responsibility. Well, you know what? I've read Donald Trump's executive order creating Doge and I'm going to read you the part that is the most important, the purpose. Section one, purpose. This executive order establishes the department of government efficiency to implement the president's Doge agenda by modernizing federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity. That's it. That is the entire purpose of Doge in this executive order. Now, he told us the purpose of Doge was to slash government, to slash waste and abuse and to slash $2 trillion out of the federal budget. What does his executive order actually say the purpose of Doge is? To modernize the federal technology and software. Oh, and it gets better. He didn't create this department, right? Because that's what he said he was going to do. He was going to create this new department of government. No, you know what he did? He renamed an existing department.

Save this and send it to a friend so everyone's prepared this coming tax season. The first thing you need to know about the earned income tax credit is you can receive it even if you don't have a qualifying dependent. Depending on the amount of dependence you have, you could also receive up to $8,046. Here are all the amounts that you will receive based upon the kids that you have. Now in addition to this, there are income limits for the earned income tax credit. This is not the child tax credit because you can receive both, but the earned income tax credits qualifying limits are above me as you can see and those will differentiate based upon the amount of children you have. The other thing is if you are claiming the earned income tax credit, the child tax credit, or you're just expecting a tax refund this tax season, make sure you electronically file and make sure that you are going to be receiving a direct deposit into your bank account.

Or do you think he will weaponize the power of the state to destroy the lives of his political enemies who he wants to die? What's scary about this? My understanding could be wrong is he's not lost a single endorsement. Democrats are standing behind him. Matt Walsh has an interesting comment about this. What it means, I'll read that in a second. On August 8th, 2022, Republican state legislature received a disturbing string of early morning texts from a former colleague, Jay Jones. This year's Democratic nominee for Virginia, AG. Jones, at the time that had recently resigned from the state house after a brief stint representing Norfolk, had strong feelings about how the political class was eulogizing recently deceased former state legislator, Joe Johnson Jr., a moderate Democrat, with a long tenure in Virginia politics. Around 8 a.m. Jones shared those feelings with his former state colleague, Republican house delegate, Kerry Quiner. In a series of texts obtained by the National Review, Jones derided Johnson's political centrism and scoffed the glowing tributes that were being made in his honor by Republicans in the wake of his death. Again, Republicans were honoring the Democrat. Damn, that was for Mark, he wrote, suggesting he'd meant to stop sending the text to somebody else. And yet that realization didn't stop Jones from joking about what that POS Gilbert would say about me if I died.

I know what it is like to have my own family vote to strip away policies that could absolutely kill me. And when you've lived through miscarriages, high-risk pregnancies, pre-eclampsia, high blood pressure, you don't forget how fragile life can be. What moms in Texas need isn't more politicians policing their bodies. It is absolute support. Paid maternity leave so they don't lose their jobs for having a baby. Affordable child care so they don't have to quit work to stay afloat, snap and welfare that could actually meet the needs of single moms and struggling families, and pregnancy clinics that are affordable, accessible and staffed with real doctors, not politics. I believe in reproductive freedom and in making it possible to raise kids without being pushed into poverty.

However, in terms of raw violence, it looks very much like bleeding Kansas. Yeah, so this, when we wrote the book on humans where we talked about that and people would say, you know, this question about the, are we in a communist revolution? Is it leading towards a civil war, a de-civilization scenario? And, you know, people would push back at us and say, well, wait, we're not seeing things like the French Revolution or the Spanish Civil War, the Bolshevik Revolution taking place. And the argument that we made is that because warfare has changed since those times, which were in many cases 100 years ago, 100 plus years ago, that we shouldn't expect it to necessarily look like it did in the past. And by the way, thank God, it doesn't, right? Because these are absolutely horrific. But we are seeing a fifth-generation wave of a communist revolution, this asymmetric warfare that's going on. It includes censorship, it includes shootings, it includes political arrest, and it includes absolutely includes political assassinations, like the assassination of Charlie Kirk. And you see direct parallels as well to bleeding Kansas, as you just mentioned, where it sort of became this free-for-all where there was violence, there was reprisal violence, and then it just spilled over. They killed, they killed reporters. People who were writing either, like, and it was both sides. You mean like a Nick Shirley? Yeah, they burned down newspaper, one of the big stories, I think, one of the big catalysts was... This needs to be taken seriously. It really does. Yeah. You know what's fascinating is how do you move a river is the issue. And the flow of culture in this country, in the direction that's going, is that at some point the river bifurcated. And as much as there have been people, and I'm not talking about myself, I'm talking about these other journalists and writers who have warned we're on the path of a civil war, there seems to be no way to resolve it because, I mean, what, Trump's not going to agree to go to prison for no reason, just because they say he should. And they're not going to back down because they're ideologically driven and they want Trump in prison. There's no stoppage. It's an immovable object and unstoppable force. The Democrats are the unstoppable force. The right is the immovable object. So it seems like, no matter what you say, and even if you do take it seriously, the only real way to take something like this seriously is to, like, I don't know, bury a shipping container underground.",en,21.9

For the last month I've been reaching out to hundreds and hundreds of brands to see if anybody would be willing to participate in my Bachelorette Giddy Bag, and to my surprise so many brands have said yes, so let's do a haul of everything I've gotten so far. I had to look this one up, Gores, a Greek skincare brand sent a box full of goodies. Each girl will be getting velvet skin drink, wide awake eye gel, volcanic skin reset mask, poreless skin cream. Oh my gosh! The girls and I might be going to Miami, but it's gonna feel like Greece, thanks to this. Next up is Intelligent Change. They sent each girl a get closer card game which is absolutely perfect. We will be playing this day one so that all the girls kind of get to know each other, break the ice, no one feels uncomfortable. This is going to be perfect. Thank you! Next up is Bondye Stands that literally sent so many goodies. Each girl will be getting a self tanning foam, a coconut lip balm with SPF, a reusable self tan application mitt, and a gradual tanning milk. Don't worry guys, we will not be looking pale in Miami. I have not planned a singular thing for this Bachelorette, but I did ask for one thing and that was to do a solid core class. Fopleadic sent each girl a set for us to be looking magic and coordinated. Each girl will be getting a navy blue sports bra with the matching leggings. And they were so kind to send one for me as well, it's just white. One of my literal favorite skincare brands, I use it every single morning and night. Cozarex also sent some goodies. Each girl will be getting a hydrogen mask, snail mucin of course, and the all-in-one cream. They also sent Spencer some items for his goodie bag and he was like next level excited. Nuculato sent over their white chocolate spread. You know the girls and I love a sweet treat and this is gonna hit with some toast. Case mate sent over a waterproof floating foam pouch to every single girl because do dust. Someone's like, destined to lose their phone. This is gonna come in handy. They also sent me a tote bag for the beach, which is so freaking cute, it has this ginormous bow on it. Are you even an influencer if you don't have an Octo buddy? Wait, this is so cute. It says we're so excited that Octo buddy gets to be a part of your special celebration. A bachelorette party is all about unforgettable moments. I agree, Octo buddy. Pink and yellow Octo buddies, one for every single girl. This is gonna be great for filming. Like I totally see all of us using our Octo buddy to film some content. I'm gonna wrap this up by saying thank you, thank you, thank you so much from the bottom of my heart to all the brands that have given stuff for my girls.

All right, so starting off, I got two big ones. Firstly, there will be no USDA loans at all. None, zero, none. Secondly, no new federal flood insurance. Another thing, since the government has shut down, it's estimated that another 750,000 employees will be getting furloughed, which means no income. Now, listen, FHA, VA, and conventional can still be closed. But one thing I'm going to tell you is that 99% of these loans are going to experience delays in one way or another. And with the state of the government, the longer this shutdown goes on, the longer those delays can be, because that's when papers start piling up, piling up, piling up. So that's something I want all my buyers and my sellers looking out for. Guys, I'm not joking when I say this. Almost every single loan during this government shutdown will be delayed, okay? Now's the time to overcommunicate with your agent, overcommunicate with your lender to avoid those delays as much as possible. Listen, in this market, during this government shutdown, there's opportunity here, okay? And there's opportunity because, A, buyers are going to be scared. Employees are getting furloughed, loans are being delayed. Some buyers are going to hear this, and it's going to get more publicized as the shutdown goes on, but they're just going to be scared. You know how exactly am I going to buy a home in this market? So less buyers, which means less demand, which means what? Better deals. So if you're a buyer that's been on the sidelines or you've been looking for some months, now's the time to get with your realtor, me, and go hard. But yeah, I hope this gives you guys a better understanding of what's going on with this government shutdown and how it actually affects real estate. Like I said, there is opportunity here, so if that's something you can take advantage of, now's the time. But yeah, if you guys are looking to buy a sell in the next 100 years, switch your boy DM. I'll see you guys in the next one. Peace.",en,21.89

There are videos coming out left and right of people having their doors broken down, children being zip tied, or people being carried away screaming. So I want to bring you guys an actual hopeful video. Well, it's still rather grim, but this video is going viral because as this man is being grabbed by ICE, the community in the south side of Chicago coalesces around him, screams at ICE, and successfully gets him free. He walks away and ICE leaves. Obviously, the entire experience is traumatic and we'll see it planned out in camera, but this is what community looks like. This is what unity looks like and you're seeing this all throughout Chicago. Before I play this clip, that is just going incredibly viral. You may have already seen it. Let me start off with the groundwork. Governor J.B. Pritzker posted just last night. This evening, President Trump is ordering 400 members of the Texas National Guard for deployment to Illinois, Oregon, and other locations within the United States. No officials from the federal government called me to directly discuss or coordinate. Just think about this. He is sending National Guard members from a red state over to blue states against the explicit objection of the governor, the officials, the police, the people living there. That is insane. All while this is happening, Donald Trump is speaking to our navalmen, speaking to service members and saying that Democrats are like a gnat that need to be taken care of. He says all the time, Democrats are evil, the party of Satan. Then he mobilizes the military. He tries to goad the military into booing Democrats. Governor Pritzker then writes, We must now start calling this what it is, Trump's invasion. It started with federal agents. It will soon include deployed federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending another state's military troops. I call on Governor Abbott to immediately withdraw any support for this decision. That's some wishful thinking right there. I'm sorry, but Governor Abbott is he's lockstep. Whenever Trump wants him to redistrict or steal an election or invade another state, he's lockstep. This says I call on Governor Abbott to immediately withdraw. There is no reason a president should send military troops into a sovereign state without their knowledge, consent or cooperation. Yep, Trump doesn't know much about consent. The brave...",en,21.78

Bonds is a topic that is going to show up on your PNC exam. So grab your notebook, grab a pen and let's get started. Today we are going to talk about who is involved in the bond. And if you have my PNC study got already, then this starts on page 30. Right. So before we get started, let's talk about what a bond is. So a bond is a financial guarantee. It is a promise from one party to the next that they are going to fulfill their obligations. If they do not fulfill their obligation, then a third party is going to step in to either make sure that the job gets done or that losses are paid. So in a bond, there is three people involved, three parties, unlike a traditional insurance contract where it is just two parties involved. So let's talk about the three parties that are involved in every bond. First party is the principal. This is the person that needs the bond. They are the one that is making the promise to do the job or to meet the obligation. The second party is the obligee. This is the person that is requiring the bond. This is usually like a government agency or city. It can even be a person that just wants to make sure that the job is done correctly. And number three is the surety. This is the insurance company that issued the bond and is going to make sure that the job is done. All right. So let me give you guys a quick example. Say that the city hires a contractor to build a bridge. The principal will be the contractor. The obligee will be the city. And then the surety would be the insurance company that issued the bond. So just remember that a bond has three parties involved, unlike the traditional insurance policy that has two. If you guys like this video and you're looking for more ways to study, I passed my insurance exam on the very first try after studying for three weeks. And I have a PNC study guide that breaks down everything that you need to know so that you can pass your exam to the link is in my bio.",en,18.88

Basically, a lot of people were worried that the content of these stories were actually happening in real life. Shortly after the accounts were discovered, all the stories and the accounts were deleted. Sarah posted online that her and her dad will no longer post on the Dream Team account anymore because the trolls quote unquote got too much. Now Sarah is saying she is moving out and is starting a job soon. And if this is the truth, this is what everybody wanted for Sarah to get out on her own away from her dad.

Cathy Wood is issuing the same warning to all investors, so let me know if you believe them or not. First, let me clarify what deflation is. Deflation is the very opposite of inflation. Inflation is when prices are going up and deflation is when prices are going down. So you may think, hey, deflation sounds like a good thing then. If prices are going down, then you can buy more goods and services, then you're going to have more purchasing power. However, the problem is if prices are going down, if there's deflation, then the economy will suffer. If you think the price of homes, cars, goods and services are going to fall over time, then what are you going to do? What are you naturally going to do? You're going to hold off on making that purchase for as long as possible, because the longer you wait, the cheaper the price will become. In this type of cycle, the producers are making less money, and in that situation, the businesses, I mean, they're going to start laying off employees.

You only want to apply this framework strategy during New York session, which is going to be from eight, nine a.m. to market close, which is four p.m. So it's going to be in this range of time right here. What you want to look for is there to be a one minute break of structure to the upside, which you can see occurs right here, a closure above that market structure. Then you want to go up a time frame to the 30 minute or one hour time frame and see how the wicks are being expressed. You then want to take your Ganbox slash rectangle to and mark the bottom wick of that candle that broke structure to the upside on the one minute. So you can see right here, this was the originating structure that broke upside on the one minute. And this is what the wick is on the 30 minute time frame. You can see it's very clear. We then want to put a limit order at the midpoint. This is called the consequent encroachment. If you guys treat ICT, and it's very simple. All you do is you put that limit order at the midpoint, you keep your stop loss right at that swing low, a little bit above it. And with your narrative, you want to target some type of high. You can see right here, we have this one minute internal high right here. We also have this one minute high that does get tapped into, but obviously you can hold this all the way to close. Specifically this internal high because well, we've already swept out these highs and then these highs are just easy targets. This is so simple guys.

It was like $3,000 and at that time we were extremely desperate. And I am, I so badly want to get this debt paid off. So every other week $200 comes out for this debt. That's $400 a month. That's outrageous to me. That's $400 a month I could have. And I've been thinking like what can I do to get rid of this loan? Like get rid of this loan. I can't deal with it anymore. I'm already struggling as it is but I think if we were to have this paid off we would be a lot better. So I've been wanting to go to the bank and get like get a loan to pay it off. That way I'm not paying nearly as much in percentage, whatever it is. I don't know how it works. But it's awful. But now with the micro payments I'm like you know what I'm just going to start putting everything I have towards this. Like if I have five extra dollars I'm just going to go pay five dollars. I'm just going to put a five dollar payment in and pay it and get it paid off. I mean what better way I feel like that is genius. I know it doesn't make sense for a lot of y'all. But to me I think it's genius. I think it's going to work great. And I'm hoping it works great. So I will keep you guys updated and let you know.

Right, or to get more specific, Oklahoma superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters says that incoming teachers from blue states will be given an America first exam before getting their state certification to teach. And this test reportedly is being developed by, of all places, Prager University. And it'll consist of 50 questions of topics like US government, religion, and gender. With Walters initially announcing this plan on a state education board meeting last month as a response to what he called a dramatic increase in teachers arriving thanks to the up to $50,000 and bonuses that the state is offering to address their crippling teacher shortage. And in this case, he was specifically pointing to teachers coming from New York and California, whose teaching standards he said are antithetical to Oklahoma's. With Walters later adding, as long as I am superintendent, Oklahoma classrooms will be safeguarded from the radical leftist ideology fostered in places like California and New York. And then saying they are trying to warp the minds of our kids to turn them into social justice warriors instead of kids that are getting the most of their God given talents to go get a good job, to go live a fulfilling life. But also, despite weeks of promises that a release of the full test is coming soon, we get to see more than a few example questions. Though also a key thing is that Walters reportedly told the education board that its members will not have a chance to review the test before it's actually implemented, which already sounds crazy before you remember the fact that teachers will be required to get every question right on this test before being allowed to teach this school year, which has already started in some districts.

Where are your, this would be a long list, where are your top five concerns on AI and what's coming? What do we need to address right away? Oh, well, right away by Christmas. So here we are, it's October already. By Christmas, we have to get out the idea. And let me, this is the first place I'll say it. Nobody should buy their children a toy with AI in it. Nobody should buy these stuffed animals that have AI. Nobody should buy dolls that have AI. Explain why. Okay, because it's one thing for kids to simply ask a question and get an answer. That's kind of cool. And we're happy having our kids use Google. Ask a question, get an answer, that's fine. But AI is now at the point where it is a synthetic person. It has conversations with you. It's very supportive, even sycophantic. It sucks up to, makes you feel good. And we already have a death toll among kids. So these AI companions, so the worst are character AI. You can make a sex partner. You can choose its personality, dominance, submissive. What color hair do you want her to have? You can see an image of her. So character AI is in the business of making sex companions for young men and women. This is insane. This is horrible.",en,15.17

I used to be swinging the hammer on 20 to 25 projects a month. We were doing stunt down remodels and ground up development projects back when the ADU wave was just starting in Seattle. Definitely been blessed to work with some of the sharpest minds in real estate through a contractor background. Managing 25 sites, a crew of 12, and various subcontractors quickly burnt me out. See, I'm a results driven individual and when things started to get out of my control such as timelines and being able to deliver on my word, I knew it wasn't for me. So I took a step out, became a real estate agent. As a real estate agent, I quickly realized that I didn't want to date somebody new every 90 days to get them into home and then wouldn't see them for another 5 to 7 years when they needed me again and if they needed me. So I quickly pivoted into becoming a hard money lender and never looked back. I've never actually touched a single conventional loan. I've always been in a hard money space and been blessed to do over 700 transactions nationwide. The reason why I tend to do well is because I honestly just focus, put the blinders on and help who's in front of me and then they spread the word about me. At the end of the day, I realize that I'm having fun doing what I'm doing and it no longer feels like work.",en,14.84

This isn't good debt used for an appreciating asset. It's debt from consumption, and it's incredibly expensive. Consider this. On a $5,000 balance, if you only make minimum payments, it could take over 15 years to pay off, and cost you more than $7,000 in interest alone.

They're going to make this a coin that can be used. It is only going to go up. I am certain of that. The projection is was $16 originally by February and now they're even thinking higher than that.

Stacey Schroeder, reality television powerhouse and former Meghan superfan, just unleashed a scorched earth takedown that has left the duchess scrambling. In a podcast moment that's already gone viral, Stacey unfollowed Meghan in real time, declared herself a former toxic fan turned toxic hater, and exposed a shocking pattern of betrayal that reveals exactly who Meghan Markle really is. This wasn't a polite breakup. This was a full-blown public execution, and what Stacey revealed is sending shock waves through Hollywood and royal circles alike. Here's what went down. For years, Stacey defended Meghan when nobody else would. She toured the entire country with Meghan's face plastered on stage every single night. She recruited people to the fan base. She made videos. She fought battles online. She was ride or die for the duchess. And in return, Meghan's team reached out five months ago, promising to send her a PR package from the lifestyle brand. Stacey waited, and waited, checking her doorstep like a fool, asking herself every morning if today would finally be the day. The package never came. She'd been baited, strung along, and then completely ghosted. But here's where the story takes a truly twisted turn. While Stacey was being ignored and humiliated, Meghan sent those exact same PR boxes to podcasters Claudia and Jackie Oshry, two women who have openly criticized and questioned her. Let that sink in.

Despite these criticisms, Kirk Franklin argues that his music has had a significant impact on the gospel genre and has played a role in attracting new audiences to the genre. It's important to stay away from Kirk Franklin's style of music. Instead, focus on worshipping God according to biblical teachings. Gospel music should prioritize spiritual edification and reverence, adhering closely to the principles and themes outlined in the Bible. Music plays a significant role in worship and should be approached with solemnity and reverence, reflecting the sacred nature of the messages conveyed in the Bible. Therefore, we should advocate for gospel music that emphasizes traditional hymns and spiritual songs, which foster a deeper connection to God and promote a more profound spiritual experience. Biblical passages such as Ephesians 5 and verse 19 and Colossians 3 and verse 16, encourage believers to sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, as well as to make melody in their hearts to the Lord. These verses endorse a more traditional approach to worship music, characterized by simplicity, humility, and a focus on glorifying God rather than entertaining audiences. Moreover, Kirk Franklin's style of music, with its incorporation of secular influences and flashy performances, may lead to a distortion of the true purpose of worship. Such music could prioritize emotionalism and entertainment over genuine spiritual growth and relationship with God, potentially leading believers astray from the core teachings of the scriptures. Geno Jennings' fearless scrutiny of Kirk Franklin's music and behavior serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of aligning one's beliefs and actions with the teachings of the Bible. By shining a light on the discrepancies between Franklin's music and traditional Christian values, Jennings prompts us to critically evaluate the media we consume and the messages we endorse. His impassioned critique challenges both artists and listeners to uphold integrity and accountability in their expressions of faith, ultimately guiding us towards a deeper understanding of the true essence of the Word of God amidst the complexities of popular culture. Through Jennings' unwavering commitment to truth, we are called to embrace discernment and critical thinking in our spiritual journey, ensuring that our beliefs and behaviors remain grounded in the principles of love, compassion, and righteousness. Focusing on true worship songs and biblical principles is paramount in shaping the music and practices of the Church. As true believers, let us continue to emphasize the importance of maintaining the integrity of worship music, as a means of glorifying God.",en,21.83

So you've got to make sure if you check with the local building and safety department, are there any co violations there too? Okay. Now it's a very simple auction. Some are going to be online. Some will be in person. A lot of times now the counties are setting limits of the amount of people who can register for an auction and they're setting up deadlines usually a week before the auction. So a lot of times they're not taking any registrations the day of the auction at all. They're doing everything before the auction. So you've got to make sure you know the rules. Okay. It's very simple, bid up premium right means whoever pays the highest amount of money will win the property. Whoever pays the highest amount of money will win the property. Okay. Do some homework. Stay at Nevada. Now their auctions are all held all different types of the year. So you've got to fully comprehend that.

Now before I show you the executive order, this is a crucial piece of data right here. If you've been waiting to buy a house or you're thinking about selling your house, this is really important. US pending home sales have fallen to a new all time low in the entire history, all time low pending home sales. There are a lot of homes for sale right now, and they are not moving. We're already close to the collapse, but now this has happened. Trump just announced that he signed an executive order terminating all regulations and processes that delay the production of timber, lumber, paper, bioenergy and other wood products. Lumber is about to get much cheaper. Now if we look at the lumber price chart, you can see that it's been skyrocketing over the past few years, and this started in the middle of 2020.

It all began with a single cryptic post that sent shockwaves through social media. Riley Burris, the usually reserved daughter of reality star Candy Burris, wrote something that instantly had people talking. Sometimes the people closest to you are the ones who silence your truth the loudest. No names, no tags, but everyone knew exactly who she meant. The post didn't stay up for long, it was deleted within hours, but screenshots spread like wildfire, and suddenly, fans were asking questions. Riley didn't deny it or clarify anything. Her silence only deepened the mystery, leaving the public to wonder what had gone wrong between her and her famous mother. Riley had always seemed quiet and mature beyond her years, but her relationship with Candy had long appeared strained to viewers who paid attention. Over the years, fans noticed awkward exchanges on the real housewives of Atlanta, moments where Riley looked distant or uncomfortable next to her mother. Many brushed it off as teenage mood swings, but now it seems those subtle expressions were glimpses into a deeper emotional struggle. The carefully polished image of Candy as a powerhouse mother and entrepreneur was beginning to crack sources close to the family say Riley's post wasn't random or impulsive. It was the result of years of built-up frustration and pain. Behind Candy's glitzy career and expanding empire, Riley allegedly felt invisible, constantly pushed aside by her mother's busy schedule, business ventures, and public life.",en,13.8

So I've known her a long time indirectly, not directly, very much. And she was always of Indian heritage. And she was only promoting Indian heritage.

Let's talk a little bit about what I hear on a monthly basis about buying property in a popular area or buying land. And I want to talk about a story when I purchased a building in Portage, Indiana. And the city wanted it and they flattened it like a pancake. I get clients or I get friends or family that say, hey, one day the town or the city or the state's going to want this is be worth a ton of money. That's not the case. If a private firm or a private sale or private buyer wants it like Walgreens or CV, I'm sorry, they're publicly traded, but Walgreens, CVS, things like that want it. Yeah, you may get paid. You may get a big fancy check. I actually sold a property for a lady named Ruth where Walgreens bought her bar and she basically retired. She went from boat to boat to boat on cruise ships for the rest of her life, which was awesome. But in cases like mine, in cases like most of the time, if the town or the city wants it, they're going to hire two different appraisal companies, average the two together, and they're just going to get market value. In my case, they wanted it so bad. I actually purchased it, rehabbed it, got it the way I wanted it, and then they wanted to flatten it like a pancake. And I believe I purchased it for under $100,000 and I got under $100,000 after with my improvements. So it wasn't a great plan, idea, or a situation for me. All that work. I got compensated for that, but it didn't work in my favor. I wasn't getting millions of dollars. So if you're holding on to something, thinking the government's going to want it and pay you, do yourself a favor and just move on because it's not going to happen. Now, if you're on a fancy corner or a special corner in a big town or city, yes, maybe eventually something big, like a nationwide franchise, will want that spot, but it is few and far between. So when you hear the words eminent domain, that's not a great thing for you. You're not going to, you're not going to win like you think you're going to win.

Trump had already tried to send in Oregon National Guard troops to Portland. That was halted on Saturday. The administration then tried on Sunday to send the troops in from California. Then late last night, Judge Karen Imragant, a Trump appointee, issued a new broader order prohibiting the administration from using federal control to send any states National Guard into Oregon and pressing the government's attorney saying, quote, you are an officer of the court. Do you believe that this is an appropriate way to deal with my order or an order that a judge issues that you disagree with or is that an appropriate mechanism to appeal as you have done? Alright folks, we have some emergency breaking news which broke late last night. Donald Trump is escalating his war on blue cities, blue states, the American people and the notion of political dissent writ large and we have to talk about it. But before we do, if you end up liking this video and you want to support the channel, please be sure to hit the like, subscribe and alert bells before you go. Alright folks, as that video explains, a Trump appointed judge, not some sort of like hippie liberal or progressive judge appointed by President Biden or President Obama, but a Trump appointed judge has slapped down repeatedly. It's almost like whack-a-mole, one right after another. Trump's attempts to federalize the Oregon National Guard, then the California National Guard and now the Texas National Guard. And we need to break down this timeline because this is incredibly dangerous. Kyle Cheney, who is a senior legal affairs reporter for Politico reports last night breaking, Judge Imigrant has called a 10 p.m. hearing on Trump's effort to circumvent her National Guard order by calling up the California troops. So we're going to break this down. And then in response to that getting struck down, just to kind of skip around here a little bit, again Trump tried to call up the Texas National Guard, Sam Stein from the Bull Work Notes, deputizing red state guardsmen to go into blue states against the wishes of the governor of that state. John Favreau of Pod Save America also made a really compelling point. Trump is now deploying red state military to blue states over the objection of the people's elected representatives in those states. He's ordering U.S. troops to patrol cities in places that at worst have a couple of blocks that could use a few more police or even some federal law enforcement. A judge that Trump appointed just ruled that Trump's deployment isn't legal, saying there's no evidence that the protests were quote, significantly violent or disruptive. But Trump is sending U.S. troops in anyway from a red state right after he told a roomful of generals that the country is a war with an enemy from within and after Trump just told the Navy that the country has to quote, take care of the Democrats. Trump is sending our military in to protect an army of mass federal agents who, while they may have begun by focusing on violent criminals, are now arresting legal residents and American citizens so they can hit Stephen Miller's quota or lose their jobs.",en,23.28

I guess they started running the AI deal on TikTok, running through people's profiles and videos. I just noticed while I was on lunch that two videos that I posted last month, one about Charlie Kirk and one about Nick Fuentes, which had both already been banned and then appealed and brought back. Both got banned today and I got a strike for each one of them. What's with that? They've already tried to take it down once last month and then they put it back up upon appeal and then out of the blue today they just took both of them down and gave me a strike for both of them. So, if you're seeing this, go... I think my Lawson Farm sale account is still up. If not, I'll get it back up tonight. And go follow me over there because I feel there's a shit in my account now. That's two strikes over pretty much the same thing. And that is also the fifth post I've had taken down in just the last few days. And every one of them had to do with conservative politics or conservative commentators. Basically, what he meant really about politics is more about the commentators. And what do you mean they bet? I mean, they ain't like I was dogged about anything. I guess the new AI scan deal doesn't like... Doesn't like you talking about Charlie Kurt or Nick Puentes or Donald Trump or pretty much anything they have to do with conservative politics or commentators because they've taken down every video that I had on my page the last few days. That's what I've been doing to you about. Anyways, have a great day. I'm going to have to work. I think I'm just doing a little tip-talk all together. I've been at this shit for almost four years. I still ain't got to $10,000 yet. My basis is waste on my time anyway. I'll just go back to Instagram. Anyways, have a great day. See you on the flip side. Peace.",en,19.86

But my question is for you, did you make some type of money off of those purchases? And if the answer is no, then that means you're just looking at all these big billion dollar companies from a consumer mindset. And we have to start shifting our mindset and start thinking how these billion dollar companies are thinking. Remember, don't just own the product, own the company. And the way to do that is to invest in the stocks. I made a video recently on what, like the easiest way and how simple it is to get in the stocks. Most people, the biggest excuses, they don't know what to invest in, but you really do know what to invest in. You buy their products every day. You buy their products every week. So the same way that you go into an Apple store to buy an Apple device is the same way that you can invest into Apple stock. And the moment that Apple does good, you make a profit off of that stock. So all we have to simply do is just switch our mindset and start thinking from an owning perspective instead of consuming it. All we do is consume and there's no money in consuming. They want us to pay top tier dollars for all these products, but they're not telling you to invest into these companies. We want to get rich, but we don't want to do the things that the rich people do. And that's investing. The game is investing. The name of the game is purchasing power, right? We want to be able to purchase whatever we want. Well, we don't, you can't save our way to wealth. We have to invest our way and that starts with building within the market. So do your research, look into investing because investing is not only for me, it's for you and it's for everybody. Funding is mandatory. So start your journey today and get started.",en,19.38

Instead, he was met with quiet tension, terse glances, and a near silence that echoed louder than any cheer. Within minutes, the question slipped from his lips. What did I do? A video, first shared on TikTok, and quickly making rounds on X and Instagram Reels captures the moment. He strides toward senior officers at the base, attempts a speech, gestures at the crowd, and then freezes. Crickets. The faces before him are unmoved. A pause, no nods, no applause, barely a whisper. What was supposed to be a display of authority turned into a moment of disorientation. Commenters online called the scene surreal, uncomfortable, and a turning point. One TikTok clip shows a general quietly exchanging glances with a colleague, while another post highlights the sudden shift in energy from expectation to hush. Many viewers couldn't help but wonder, how often do we see a leader so publicly paused? Why this moment feels like good news? Yes, it was awkward. Yes, it was unexpected.

I was told that I am unwilling to have a discussion with an opposing point of view, that I shut down dialogue and that I am not nice. All of those things have been true, right? I can admit that those can be true. This is more so like in my personal life, not necessarily on TikTok. But there is a common denominator here. There is a factor here that is pretty big. I absolutely think that having respectful discourse and conversation surrounding some of these very critical issues that we are facing in America right now is incredibly important. I'm talking about the people who are a bit neutral, who maybe don't want to look at the big thing, who is very overwhelming. Maybe they have MAGA family members and it's hard for them to speak up. Maybe we have differing beliefs as far as abortion and healthcare and things like that, right? Very important, valid conversations to be had. We need to come up with some solution. Where I draw the line. Let me get myself together. If you support this administration, we have nothing to discuss. Nothing. I don't trust your intentions. I don't trust your intelligence. I don't trust you at all. If you can look at this administration and not reflect critically on yourself as well, we are way too divided on the spectrum to have a conversation about it. We live in two different realities. That's fair. Because I'm just like, what are we going to talk about? You support Hegzeff, Stephen Miller. What are we going to talk about? Truly. I'm just wondering, like, am I wrong? Am I wrong? Am I wrong? You can be a Republican. You can have opposing views on everything.

But I wonder if you can explain the thinking there, because I feel like there's a little bit of a leap of logic to it, which makes it not translate to non-expert news consumers about this. I mean, the idea is that you'd attack infrastructure, you'd cause people material pain, you'd cause chaos and upset, and then somehow there's a slippery slope that results in race war and white people taking over and genocide against non-white people. Like, why do they believe that infrastructure attacks and resulting chaos ultimately accelerate us to some race war future where they think they're going to win? So infrastructure attacks and mass casualty violence and show of power attacks are all meant to do the same thing in the ideology of this movement, which is laid out in books like The Turner Diaries and in movement, ideological writings of other kinds. They are all supposed to awaken other people to what these activists see as these...",en,12.56

In a heartfelt exchange on Apple TV+, Esther-Eluctant Traveller, Prince William opened up to actor Eugene Levi about the profound challenges of 2024, a year marked by the cancer diagnoses of both his wife, Catherine, Princess of Wales, and his father, King Charles III. He spoke of shielding their three children Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis from the emotional turbulence, while acknowledging Catherine's remission and the king's ongoing treatment. Catherine's path to recovery began in the shadow of her January 2024 abdominal surgery, which unexpectedly led to a cancer diagnosis announced in March. After months of chemotherapy, she completed treatment in September 2024 and shared her remission in January 2025, a milestone that allowed her to resume duties at her own pace. June 2024 marked Catherine's first major outing since her diagnosis, trooping the colour, the annual celebration of the monarch's official birthday. For the occasion, Catherine channeled quiet optimism in a recycled white Jenny Packham coat dress from her 2022 collection.

SBI has announced that they're doing a Bitcoin ETF and an XRP ETF. Now let me explain to you how important this is, why can't they talk about XRP, BTC as my number one and number two holding. What is an ETF and how is it important to the financial ecosystem? What we need to understand is traditional finance, TRADFI and DEFI, decentralized finance, are molding together like I told you guys was going to happen. Traditional banks are going to become DEFI crypto banks and crypto banks are going to become traditional banks. So what you're going to see is as Coinbase you'll be able to deposit your direct deposit, you'll be able to do your bill pay, you'll be able to operate like a normal bank and you'll be in the driver's seat. So we're in the first phase which is adoption and that's why these ETFs are so important. And exchange traded funds means that you're buying these on the stock side. So for example, the catalyst of 19, I think this would make it 20 XRP ETFs waiting to be approved would bring institutional adoption in. So Mrs. Jones, the baby boomer isn't going to go to Coinbase and buy XRP or go to Coinbase and buy Bitcoin and buy the actual asset. She would rather go to her financial advisor and do it through an ETF and exchange traded fund which she would own it on the stock side. Now people ask me all the time, what would you rather do? I want to hold it. I own XRP myself. I hold the token. I hold Bitcoin. Now this would be an exchange traded fund giving you exposure to it on the stock side. You don't hold the actual token. So you get the benefit of the price appreciation but you don't have the risk of holding the asset on Coinbase, things like that and you're in institutional stocks basically. So you get the benefit of the price appreciation, the same depreciation. For example, BlackRock is number two in Bitcoin now through their IBIT Bitcoin ETF. So people that own the ETF don't own the actual token. They own exposure through BlackRock to Bitcoin. They own exposure through SBI through the XRP ETF. But this is showing you, improving to, like we told you, that it is going to be traditional finance. XRP and Bitcoin will be number one and number two.",en,22.65

I'm going to be able to speak in a language that I don't know how to speak. It is called the Dutry Duty. What is that? What is that? I thought you were going to speak in a language that I don't know how to speak. Obedience, loyalty, disclosure, confidentiality, accountability, and reasonable care. I don't know how to speak in a language that I don't know how to speak. That means, if I don't speak legally, I can't speak. I can't speak in a license or in a risk. So, under the state of Minnesota law, I don't know how to speak in a language that I don't know how to speak. I obey. Obedience. In that, I don't know how to speak confidential information. I am loyal. And I listen. You know? I think that in a law, you should negotiate on your own. Then discuss on your own, because that is a priority. It is a great benefit in my opinion. Imunition on your behalf. Now, you know that of your age, right? Now, do you understand your blame? What you are talking about, and you do understand, doesn't it? Do you understand your responsibility? If you want to speak similarly, you don't have to speak only English. Also, if you want to come, take me there if you want Ok? And then, legally, if you can't come, you exclusively work with me When I finished, I decided to buy staff items an expense cap Ok? Hopefully, expire soon. I'll be back in August. I'll be back soon.

Have you ever Swifties? And as someone who's kind of middle of the road on everything like I don't have any personal vested interest in Taylor Swift Some of her songs are bangers and some of them aren't and some of the things that she does is awesome And some of the things is not so much. I will say that I think some of you are looking at her lyrics as like What they are and not the master level Easter eggs that she's used to doing I definitely would consider myself a Swiftie so like I can't even tell you what the Easter eggs are I just know that there's more always behind the scenes of this woman's lyrics than what meets the eye But also at the end of the day, I think people are judging super harshly. This is just a celebrity She's a musician and while she may be an icon and whatever like she was never a political activist She was always just a talented singer-songwriter guitarist, but I will say that her marketing is top tier and and what I mean by that is that You hating on her right now is still drawing attention to her So if you really believe that she's problematic You should probably stop drawing attention to her because that is how she markets You know she does all of these things so that even if you hate her you're going to talk about her at the end of the day I think there's more than you see I to these lyrics and I'm sure some high-level Swiftie is going to find all the Easter eggs and A few months from now It'll be revealed that there's some lyrical genius in whatever it is that you guys find problems with and listen I'm not saying that she shouldn't be a political activist because she has so much power to do so I'm just saying that you guys are treating her like she is and she's a musician that rarely ever speaks on politics In her entire career. So what did you really expect with this album? You can come for me if you want but it's just Taylor Swift being Taylor Swift like either you like it or you don't And I haven't even listened to it I've only heard clips and heard opinions as outspoken as I am on politics And there's a lot of terrible stuff happening right now I do think that People cling to a little bit of happiness that they're able to feel is a good thing And so I'm not going to hate on her for having like somewhat of a happy time Creating her art at the end of the day with what is happening in the political climate that we're in We have to find those moments of joy",en,20.3

Chuck Schumer did the right thing in the spring and led the Senate to a clean CR. What we've got here is the House has passed a clean CR, the Republicans have the votes in the Senate and he will not allow his members to come across. And what's changed since then is it's his poll numbers. So the President, Vice President Bantz, Speaker Johnson, Leader Thune, they're not negotiating with Chuck Schumer and Kim Jeffries, they're negotiating with Representative Acasio Cortez because she's nipping at his heels. And so the American people are being held hostage by Chuck Schumer's poll numbers. And we're starting to see some of the moderate, the very few moderate numbers left in the Democratic Party and the Senate drift toward wanting a solution. Chuck Schumer's blocking it. When I look at Chuck Schumer and Kim Jeffries, straight out of Brooklyn, makes me glad that I left New York in 2020.

If you're a creative, a designer, a writer, a coach, an artist, and you're relying on one client, one contract, one platform to pay you, anger bills, playing, financial, Russian roulette. Here's why multiple streams of income are not optional. They are essential. Stability vs. Scarcity. Clients cancel. Platforms change algorithm. Seasons slow down. When you have three, five, or even seven income sources, one hiccup doesn't crash your whole business. You breathe easier. Sleep better. Create freely. 2. Scale without burnout. You can't trade time for money forever. Passive income like digital products, courses, ebooks, templates, affiliate offers allow you to earn while you sleep or while making your next album, which gets into number three. Creativity thrives with freedom. When you're not scrambling to pay rent with every project, you're able to experiment. Launch that passion side hustle. You're not just a freelancer anymore. You're a brand, a system, and a business owner. Start small and start smart. Turn one service into a digital product. Templates, checklists, mini-course. Monetize your knowledge. YouTube, Patreon, WAP, license your art or designs. Find affiliate partnerships in your niche. Offer one-on-one coaching or group programs. The truth, most successful creatives aren't the best at one thing. They're the ones who build systems to make money while they live their lives.

A lot of people at me think time is their friend. You know, hey, let's test the market. Let's just put it out there. I'm not in a rush, but in reality every extra day on the market is the market voting, not worth it. Now let's flip the rolls. Your home buyer, you see two houses listed on the market. One's been on the market for seven days. The other's been on the market for 180. Are you submitting the same offer on both? Highly unlikely. Fresh one, most likely you're coming in strong because you know there's a momentum. A lot of buyers are circling around it. And on a stale one, you smell blood. You're gonna come in low and try to negotiate the best possible deal. That's exactly how buyers think. And I know this firsthand from experience. So when you're selling, it's not just about what you want. It's really about what the market is saying. And the market will always talk through showings, offers, feedback and silence.

I did a whole video on this. I looked deep, deep into what was going on in her life around this time, and it looks like it's all correlating.

So how this correlates with the theory I had and the video I made is this. This was the video she posted on April 4th, and it was about that sleep medication she was taking too much of. Basically, I had come to the conclusion that she was, you know, taking too much 5-HTP or could have been a serotonin overdose. But unfortunately, that's looking like what this is.

Was there anything special about it? No, it's a pill. It's not more expensive, a little bit more expensive to make, but not much more. Right? And so what we said was, when you go to costplusdrugs.com, you put in a matnip, we're gonna show you our actual cost. And then we're gonna show you that our markup is 15% because we want you to know that this is a fair markup.

Okay, there will be a pretty major crypto winter in 2026. It's just how the cycles work. Now, through the law of diminishing returns, also comes the law of diminishing losses. So technically, this bear market will be slightly less harsh than the previous bear cycles. But that doesn't mean you should hold your cryptos throughout the bear cycle because we're still going to see significant drawdowns. Okay, I believe that Bitcoin is going to still retrace at least 50 to 70% from its high and it's going to drag altcoins down with it. Over 90%, even the large caps with the adoption, they will all crash. Okay, once the momentum starts rolling in the other direction, it's going to be really, really hard to stop. Everything is just going to come crumbling down. Okay, and I understand ETFs and institutions are getting in, but just think about it. Once the momentum starts, you know, just like we see momentum pushing Bitcoin up right now, once the downward momentum starts, it will be very, very hard to stop. And since Bitcoin is one of the greatest assets that institutions are buying and the wealthy is parking their money, once everyone starts selling and rotating into safer assets, okay, everyone is going to be selling the same asset. And that is Bitcoin. Okay, when everyone holds the same asset and then everyone also starts to flock to safer investments, everyone will be selling the same asset. Okay, there's going to be so much downward pressure on Bitcoin next year. And I do not think 2026 is an exception, especially for altcoin holders. You do not want to get stuck holding next year.

I'm about to explain that to you. 401K is a company's sponsored retirement account where employees can contribute a percentage of their total income. Employers often match a certain percentage of these contributions. So for example, the most common contribution rate that employers match is 5%. So for instance, if you contribute 5% of your income, your employer will match 5%. If you contribute 10% of your total income, your employer will only match 5% still. A 401K account is essentially a pre-tax account compared to your Roth IRA, which that is a post-tax account. Contributing to a 401K account reduces your taxable income. So let's say for example, your base salary is 100K. If you contribute 10% to your 401K, your taxable income would be $90,000 instead of $100,000. Reducing your taxable income means less taxes that you owe and you might lower your tax bracket depending on how much you contribute. It is highly recommended that you contribute the same percentage that your employer would match. So if it's 5%, contribute 5% of your income, but it also doesn't hurt to add a little bit more to that rate percentage because you reduce your taxable income. And don't forget, this is a long-term investment for your future.",en,13.57

In 2020 I joined the Creator Awards program and in 2021 and 22 I stayed home with my son and I made pretty good money on here because at that point there wasn't the one-minute video length requirement to monetize so I made like 80 to 100 dollars a week which is a stay-at-home mom I think that's pretty good for me it is anyways. Of course more would be nice but I think that was pretty good. Anyway so I'm still in the Creator Awards program and if anybody else is trying to do the same thing pay their car off pay their credit cards off whatever it may be to join the Creator Awards program in order to do that you have to have at least 10,000 followers and you have to have over 100,000 views in the last 30 days whenever you apply and of course you have to be over the age of 18 and then after that to monetize on your videos they have to be over a minute long they have to have views from the 4u page other views don't like count as qualified views the people that watch it from the 4u page have to watch it for at least five seconds for its account and the views cannot be from the same person so whenever people say like I watched it all the way through watched it five times watched it ten times the watching it more than once doesn't actually count towards the monetization I don't even know that it counts towards your views anymore because I've noticed that whenever people say that it'll only go up as if one person watched it so I don't even think it counts like as a separate view anymore but it definitely doesn't count to help monetize so a lot of people see the trend like paying my car off their tiktok and they think that you're asking people for money but really you're not and really it's free to help you're getting paid through tiktok just like a job and watching the video giving it a like a comment like somehow some way to boost it that's what helps and it's completely free to do so nobody is saying like send me money and I see a lot of hate comments whenever people do these videos and I truly think it's just because some people don't know how it works",en,18.85

So you may want to stop being a slave to the old earth because if you believe working harder is the answer. You're still hardwired from 1960 and beyond. So now that it's 65 years has changed the way people earn income. So if you're still chasing money the way people did 65 years that you're living under a mental operating system. That was built to keep you tired and just overbroke. So right now if you feel frustrated, overwhelmed, tired, playing your A-game and can't get ahead. That my friends confirms that you're operating in the old operating system. It's fucked up how people will work their bodies to the graves before they ever sit down and talk to somebody who knows or research it themselves on how their own mind can create what they actually want. The 3D matrix has taught us to trade your life for pennies and call it responsibility. The old earth mindset says grind harder, sacrifice more, obey, comply and you'll get rewarded a little bit at the very end of life. It taught us to believe that freedom was earned through exhaustion and decades of hard work. It taught us to believe that our power was outside of us like in a religion, in a boss, in a system, in a paycheck, out of our control. And millions are still living under the outdated operating system. Breaking their fricking backs while their dreams stay untouched. So the shift that's helping so many people is realizing we're not a worker, we're actually creators. Because every single human being has God power inside of them with the ability to design their own life, their own income and their own fricking futures and realities. So if you're not locking in that personal power and creating your own desires, you're running old code. And the second you uninstall that operating system and start using your mind instead of your muscles, you stop surviving and you start thriving and creating. So here's the truth, your freedom won't come from working harder. How long have you been trying that strategy? How long have you been frustrated with them fucking results? So this is your invitation to step into the new earth. It exists right now, where you're no longer a slave to that old programming. But a conscious creator in charge of your own reality. So if you're ready, if you're committed, if you're fucking serious about breaking free from the 3D matrix and you want to learn how to activate that power inside of you. DM me the word awakened and I'm going to show you how to start reprogramming your life. Guys, change can happen really, really fast with the right blueprint. You were just taught that it couldn't. Also like and follow for more ways to break out of the 3D matrix and start living a more freedom lifestyle. I'll see you on the next one.",en,22.34

He spent 50 minutes circling an Alaskan airbase on the phone with engineers trying to fix his landing gear before his jet crashed. And that's not even the worst part. The hydraulic fluid was contaminated with water that froze solid in negative one degree weather, turning his advanced F-35 Lightning into a flying trap. While he's burning fuel and running out of options, five Martin engineers are desperately trying to save a $200 million aircraft through a conference call of all things.

Okay, so number one is emotional spending. You're spending money, you're buying things because you're bored, you're stressed, or you're sad. We've all been there. Here's a tip for you. Wait 24 hours. So like let's say for instance you're thinking about buying something that you haven't planned to buy. Wait 24 hours and see if after 24 hours you still want it. If you do, then girl go ahead and go get it. This is your life. But most of the time you're not going to want it. Okay, y'all. So number two is buy now, pay later. Those Clarina after pay apps will have you thinking that things are affordable when they're actually probably not. You can't afford it. That's why you're looking at those apps. Okay, let's be honest. Four small payments can easily turn into 10, 12 active ones. So the tip I would give you is if you cannot afford it now, you probably cannot afford it later. You should start saving your money. Number three is lifestyle creep. Whenever your income increases, so do your bills. You get the better car, the nicer phone, the bigger house. Don't do that. At least for a while. Allow your bills to stay the same for a little bit so you can then invest. Number four, saving your money and not investing it. Your money is going to lose value. Saving it under your mattress in a shoebox in your closet is not going to do anything beneficial for you. My tip, start investing your money. Even if it's just $50, $100 a month into a account, it's going to grow in compound interest. And number five, money trap is not budgeting your money. You're not tracking where your money goes. You don't know what's coming in and what's going out. Probably running your finances on your emotions and not on your goals. So my tip would be giving every single dollar a job, even if it's fun money. Every single dollar that comes into this bank account, baby, you got a job. Get to work. Once I started fixing these things, because everything I tell you is what I personally have done or am doing in my life, you will see a major change in your finances. Okay. Love you. Bye.",en,19.24

Plaintiffs ask this court to halt the illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional federalization of members of the National Guard of the United States, including both the Illinois and Texas National Guard. Now that last bit stems from the fact that the administration is planning on setting over 400 troops from Texas to Illinois as well as other places.

Hey Chase! Hey Corey! Tell me, what is Prop 50 all about?

But if Prop 50's passed, it would temporarily lift back and be likely beneficial for Democrats in the next midterm elections. Yeah, election is November 4th.

You can see this being updated just three hours ago. Also, Trump threatens to bomb Iran unless they end nuclear weapons program and begin talks on a new deal. Iran, we are hearing, has rejected the offer of direct US negotiations over rapidly growing nuclear programs. So that is why we're hearing that there are threats of bombings because this offer of negotiations has been rejected. Iran and the US threat of war, five things to watch. Now this coming out two days ago, before I was rejecting this, and now there are threats of bombs being dropped in the Middle East. And take a look at this.

I am an apartment locator in North Carolina, which also means I am a licensed real estate agent. So, since posting on Six-Lot, these are the two biggest things I've been seeing that you guys would know about apartment locating. So, we gonna get into it. First things first, everyone always asks, is there a fee? Do you guys charge? No, there is no fee, y'all. So, using an apartment locator in North Carolina, it is completely free. We work directly with the apartment complexes in townhomes and we are paid directly through them. So, the service is completely free to all clients. Next, we have gatekeeping. And why I don't post the name of the properties on my posting up here. So, you guys, I am a licensed real estate agent. My job is completely commission-based. All I need you guys to do is fill out the form and that lets the property know that I referred you to the apartment or the townhome. I promise, I'm not gatekeeping. I want you guys to live in these properties as bad as you guys do. So, all you have to do is fill out the form and that's how the complex knows that I referred you. That's how I get paid. That's how you live in your dream apartment, you guys.",en,15.15

No one has ever found anything suggesting that, you know, Latinos and black people are somehow less intelligent than white northern Europeans, which Trump just suggested.

What? How? Compound interest. Each day, I earn 1% on the new total. Not just the original dollar. So the growth keeps growing. Okay, but that can't be that much. 1% daily means it multiplies by about 38 each year. So year one, I had $38. Year two, $14.28. Year three, $53,939. And last year, I had already $2 million.

No major news today, government remains shut down, but there was a big deal between OpenAI and AMD shooting AMD much higher, about 40%. But it's kind of this tale of two cities we've been talking about. You're either tied to the AI story or you're not. And so it's really weird dichotomy, but we are shooting much higher. This is a lot reminiscent of the 90s tech bubble where it seemed like everybody was going to be a winner. But when everything shook out there was just one major search engine, one major retailer and so on. But right now there's currently probably a dozen major AI plays. They think they're all going to win. So in the meantime, we're just going to continue to melt higher, especially with no other news. But you just got to wonder how long this could last.

I didn't go to college. I wonder what would have happened if I did go to college. I'll never know. I know now the trend is don't go to college, don't go to college. But I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm not sure. You know, it wasn't for me. If they would have gave me a stack of cash to go to college, it still wouldn't have been for me. It wasn't like I couldn't afford it or whatever. It just wasn't for me. I knew I wanted to hit the ground running. I was too amped up. I didn't excel in school. I was seized. I got seized. That's what I got. So that's just me. I knew it wasn't for me. If someone else was going to pay for it, I still went to be going to college. So you got to look at yourself. If you're a person that excels in school and likes education and thinks you could do better because you have a higher education, then by all rights, go do that. You want to be a mechanical engineer or whatever. You're going to need college. But the type of things I was thinking of, college wasn't going to be what I needed at the time. I wanted to open up a business now. I was willing to open up a landscaping company. I would have opened up anything. I would just want to get into business as fast as I could and college would have gotten the way. So it's just how you feel and what's best for you. I don't think that there's a bad thing about college. I wanted to educate my children. So I was willing to pay for my kids as college and their expenses while they were in college. I don't jump on trends like, oh, don't go to college. And that seems to be the popular thing to say right now. I don't buy into that. I think it's an individual decision based on what you feel is best for yourself. Don't go to college because your parents want you to go, but don't not go to college because Gary Vee or someone else says, don't go to college. I'm not sure what's best for you. Do what you think is best for you and then make that decision and then go full speed. Make it happen. Don't use money as an excuse to go or not to go. And don't use time either. Guess what? There's time out there. You got time and you can come up with business ideas. You can do real estate. You can do a lot of things while you're in college. There's those connections you're going to have for the rest of your life. I don't have those connections because I didn't go to college. So maybe I shorted myself. I don't know.",en,23.54

We raised north of a million dollars and it was really hard. We got a lot of notes and I'm a serial entrepreneur. I've done this before. I've raised lots and lots of money and because it was hard, I thought I'd share five of the things here that I took away from that process. Number one and probably my favorite and this is the thing that always drives me is be different. Like really own a space, own a category, something that is unique to you, a space that people haven't seen before, something that is disruptive, something that is uniquely tied to like a personal why for you. Not like a new product. That's the 50th version of something that's come before. Number two, where do you show up with this product? How are people going to find out about you? Distribution, having a really, really thoughtful understanding of how are you going to get this product out into the world? That can be like the second thing that you think about often, but it really should be the first. What's the unfair advantage? How are you seek with sync channels when you are launching digitally? How are you showing up on shelf? Are you showing up broad? Are you showing up narrow and deep? And do you have that really thought through and is there some type of unfair advantage? Number three, sweat the details. This space, I'm launching a new company that I've hadn't built something in before in the CPG space. Everybody tells you that sense matter and they matter so hugely. And are you showing up literally like pre-revenue before this product is even out with just solid and like really convincing understanding of your margins? And how does margins improve over time? What that looks like and are those margins convincing to begin with? People apparently show up with margins in the 20s when they first launched pre-revenue. We got to be in the mid 40s with the path to getting to North, the high 50s, low 60s. But it's just super important. Number four, brand obsession. I love this point too. When people get this product for the first time, do they love it? Are they texting you about it? Are they not able to get enough of it? It's tough because it's early days proving that out. But you want to have enough proof points that people really, really are just advocates and just like mega fans. And then number five, I already said it, but it's just it's super hard to raise money. It's always hard to raise money. It's hard to raise money in the consumer space. It's even hard to raise money in the CPG space. I found that there is a lot of investors willing to take less upside now for just waiting it out and seeing if there is traction. That puts a lot of people like myself in a bind. You know, you have to like, you know, what comes first, you got to get going, you need capital to do it. But I found that if you write it out, there's so much access to capital. There's so many people you'll eventually find your people, the people that really get it. And that proved the case for us. It's just one more test until sticky to it and writing it out and eventually it falls into place. So that's it.",en,26.98

Donald Trump was speaking to a crowd when he decided to go on a bit of a tangent, I guess, and he started talking about forts. Now, I'm not talking about like a little treehouse or build. I'm talking about, you know, military installations. And this is what Donald Trump had to say. We won world wars out of forts, fort Benning, fort this, fort that many forts, they changed the name. We won wars out of these forts. They changed the name. They changed the name of the forts. A lot of people aren't too happy about that. They changed the name of a lot of our forts. We won two world wars out of a lot of these forts and they changed the name. It's unbelievable. Now in case you're wondering, as I was reading that, I didn't accidentally reread a couple of the same lines. That is literally the entire train of thought that Donald Trump had right there. And I repeated it to you verbatim the way he said it repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, repetitive. They changed the name. We won the wars. They changed the names. We won the wars. They changed the name. He sounded like a broken record. So when I saw this, here's what I did. I looked up medical symptoms. This repeating, even in the same sentence where you start repeating like this, it can be that I'm not saying Trump has it, but based on all of the other things that have happened recently, it seems to fit. I am not a medical professional. I did not go to medical school and I do not have a PhD, but based on my reading, this is in fact something that is seen with people who suffer from dementia in the early stages.

First, grab a strong thread and use our threading tool to thread the needle quickly. Start by poking the needle out from the inside at the edge of the strap. Then insert it at the center point, poke out from the left side, and pull the thread tight. Insert the needle at the center again, poke out from the right side, and pull tight. Repeat this. Always insert at the center, then poke out left or right, crossing and pulling the thread each time. Keep stitches under 1 cm. Always use strong, durable thread for sewing. Many of you say I sew so effortlessly, but your needle feels glued when you sew at home. Hard to poke or pull. The reason? We use different needles. Most of you use flimsy iron needles. This is my steel needle with a big eye, sharp tip, smooth body, and amazing piercing power. I can pierce 20 plus layers of denim without a thimble. It won't bend, break or rust, and glides through fabric in seconds. Iron needles are soft, easy to break and have tiny eyes. Threading is a nightmare. Our steel needles are easy to thread. Even if you have presbyopia or myopia, use our custom threading tool. Hook the needle, loop the thread, done in 1 second. No help needed. We're giving you a pair of these threaders today. For slippery or sweaty hands, we'll add a pair of thimbles. Also included, a pro grade seam ripper, used by Taylors. Great for unpacking parcels, removing tags, opening buttonholes, or ripping seams. Its sharp tip picks up threads. Rounded tip protects fabric. Just slide and push to open. We're throwing this in too. Custom thread snaps easily when altering clothes. We're including three spools of my durable hand sewing thread. The steel needles come in five sizes. Big for quilts, small for embroidery. You get 25 needles total. Stored in a handy bottle for easy organization. The full set, 25 steel needles, one pair of threaders, one pair of thimbles, one seam ripper and three spools of thread. Only $6.99. With free shipping, we've linked it here for you. After sewing, pull the thread tight. Wrap it inside the strap, tie a knot, and snip off extra thread. There, your strap is shorter. See?

The token is Soul Pump and they have a website where people can go and play games and earn rewards and all types of things. But that's not the coolest part about this token. The coolest part is that this token does buy back and burns from the revenue directly from the website every single day. As you can see here's some of the examples of the amount of money that they buy back and burn of the token every single day. Including here on week two where they burned over $60,000 worth of the token and the week three burn information is coming out today or tomorrow about how much they burned last week which is crazy. And part of this is due to the token numbers where they said they're going to be taking 20% of all the revenue that they make every day and do daily buy back and burns of the token. So that's just 20% of the revenue. Imagine if they ramped it up but also forget 40% of the tokens that they have as a plot is going to get airdrop to later users of the website. They do a one-soul airdrop every couple hours directly on the website and any active users can partake and take a share of this one soul that they give out every couple hours. On top of that they have Daily Craze which you can open every 24 hours per user which have various rewards. Including that one right there. I know y'all can read if you use my code when you sign up. Now you may be watching and you want to ask how to get involved. First you're going to need and what I recommend is the Solana Phantom wallet. You can download that on the Google Store or on the Apple Store. Once you do that you're going to head to the link tree link in my bio. Go to Soul Pump and copy that link. If you hold it it should pop up like this and just hit copy link. After that you're going to head back over to your Phantom wallet. Make sure you have some Solana crypto on there.

That was the market from before. Things have changed guys, things have changed. So yes, over the past five years in general, if a house is on the market for more than a week, something was probably wrong with it. Two weeks, definitely something going on with it. Now the way the market has shifted, we have more inventory, which means you guys, the buyers have more to choose from. So if you're looking around and you see a house that's been on the market for a week, two weeks, don't automatically think you can go in and low ball it by 50K. It could just be that the average days on market for homes in that town is 21 days. Maybe that's it and the house hasn't been sitting that long. So make sure you ask your realtor who should be me anyway. You're watching my videos. Why are you not just asking me? Just ask me. So I'm going to be asking you guys, what are the average days on market for this particular town before you go in and try to low ball anything? Follow me for more tips.

Born into wealth and fame, King's attempt to portray himself as street-certified has turned into one of the most public examples of image collapsing under reality. Everything came crashing down after a traffic stop in October 2024 spiraled into a full-blown scandal. Police pulled him over for swerving, immediately smelling weed and spotting a loaded gun on his hip. When they ran his name, an active warrant popped up from a past DUI case he failed to show up for. What followed was a mix of confusion, denial, and panic as King insisted he had no outstanding cases, only to realize he was caught in his own web of carelessness. The viral footage showed a nervous, lost young man, not the confident online persona he sold to millions. The arrest exposed how deeply King had fallen into the trap of pretending to be something he's not. Officers found multiple firearms in his car, including an AR-15-style rifle. Because of his prior juvenile felony, that alone could have landed him serious prison time. His attempts to talk his way out of the situation, admitting to having guns while baking police not to search, only made things worse. The internet devoured the footage, mocking the contradiction between his tough talk and frightened demeanor. He was extradited to another county, spent days behind bars, and by the time he was released on bond, the damage was already done.",en,15.4

Now I don't know if he's gonna let the government shut down, but if he does, I know he's not gonna lose a wink of sleep over it because the Bureau of Labor Statistics he just released a 73 page report on what they'll do if the government shuts down. And in that 73 page report was the news that they will not release a September jobs report on Friday if the government is shut down. Also won't release weekly unemployment claims. And in the middle of October if the government still shut down, they won't release inflation data either. When on top of that, they're gonna stop collecting data from employers the whole time, which would virtually guarantee October's report is corrupted and incomplete. Not unlike every sentence out of Trump's mouth. The timing really couldn't be better because a major job market researcher just announced that seasonal hiring is the lowest it's been since 2009, which if you recall was a catastrophic recession. And of course everyone knows the job market is trash because of Donald Trump's tariffs and the non-stop chaos in the economy when all employers want is stability. But Trump wants to hide from it because if you don't count it, it isn't real. Just like back in 2020 when a whole ship full of passengers who were sick desperately needed a dock so that the passengers could find a hospital. Trump didn't want him to dock here not because he was worried about getting doctors sick, but because he didn't want to count 14 cases because really when it comes down to",en,14.4

They're gonna do things like track your location and they're gonna steal your data and sell it to people, which is literally no different than any other social media website in the country. It's no different than Amazon. It's no different than what these other American media outlets do, not even social media, regular media outlets. You sign up for something online, they own your data and they sell it to anybody willing to buy it legally. But we were told that TikTok was evil because they were doing the same thing that American CEOs were doing. And therefore, President Biden signed the legislation saying TikTok has to be sold or it's out of the United States forever. Now, Trump pledged he was gonna save TikTok. TikTok's not going anywhere. We're gonna keep it. And he made true on that promise, given credit for that. The only problem is, of course, is that TikTok is being sold in the United States to two of the most far right propagandists imaginable. One of them, of course, Donald Trump's good buddy, billionaire Larry Ellison, who's in the process of turning CBS into a conservative media outlet. And the other person is Rupert Murdoch, the owner and founder of Fox News, the owner of the Wall Street Journal, hardcore conservatives, one of whom is a master of right wing propaganda, basically changed the game, invented right wing propaganda almost. And those are the two nut jobs that are now going to own TikTok. So if you think that TikTok is going to just continue operating as is, you know, oh, we got nothing to worry about, they're not gonna stifle anybody on the left, you got another thing coming. Because that is absolutely gonna happen. Don't believe me? How about the fact that when Donald Trump signed this order just a couple weeks ago, he said he'd like to make it 100% MAGA. He'd like to censor influencers by tweaking the algorithm so that content is 100% MAGA. That's what he said on camera while signing the papers. He wants to make it 100% MAGA. And sure, you could argue like, well, he said after that he was joking. Yeah, because Donald Trump jokes around a lot and never follows through on doing anything that he jokes about, right? Right? If it doesn't land, he'll say he's joking, but that doesn't change his overall scheme. And even if Trump hadn't blatantly admitted that he's turning TikTok into a MAGA propaganda machine, the two people running it were gonna do it anyway.

I'll be following the medic to Eskenazi patients, Craig O'Rourke and I'll. Police say Sanchez approached a 69-year-old truck driver in the loading dock of a downtown Indianapolis hotel. The driver told police Sanchez smelled of alcohol and his speech was slurred. Court records say Sanchez climbed into the truck and prevented the driver from calling for help before there was a fight. And Sanchez shoved the driver. Sanchez ended up pepper sprayed and stabbed multiple times after the driver told police he thought to himself, this guy's trying to kill me. This is a situation that didn't need to happen and should not have happened. The allegations involved here involved a 38-year-old former professional athlete becoming involved in a physical confrontation with a 69-year-old man who was just attempting to do his job. Sanchez, who played eight seasons in the NFL, was in Indianapolis to be part of the broadcast team for Sunday's Colts Raiders game. Clerk Sanchez was involved in an incident that, to be honest, we're all still trying to wrap our heads around. At this time, our thoughts and prayers are with Mark, his family and all those involved. Sanchez is now charged with battery, unlawful entry to a motor vehicle and public intoxication, and he's tentatively set to appear in court tomorrow. Maybe we'll get some more answers.

How many times have the experts been wrong about the direction of this country? People continue to doubt President Biden again and again, and yet each time he comes out on top, each time things are better than what everybody expected. Now, where were those jobs added?

And I want you to know that it doesn't matter if you're new to the stock market or if you're experienced, you need to know what's going on when it comes to index fund investing. Because you can use index funds and ETFs to make you a better investor. So today, I'm teaching you about index fund investing which includes what is an index fund, the pros and cons, index funds versus ETFs and how to invest in them. So let's start with this. What is an index? An index is simply a grouping of stocks or bonds or other securities. So for example, the S&P 500 is an index of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the US. So the thing is that you cannot invest directly in an index but you can invest in an index fund. Now, let me explain to you how an index fund actually works. So let's say that you have an index fund that tracks the S&P 500. So that index fund will buy shares of stock in all the companies in the S&P 500. Therefore, the index funds will mirror the performance of the S&P 500.",en,13.23

Zania Onotop, from GoldenEye, the deadly femme fatale who crushed men between her thighs, wasn't just Hollywood imagination. She was directly inspired by Zinnia Sergeiwa, a real GRU operative who terrorized Western Europe in the 1980s. Sergeiwa was a former gymnast recruited as a honey trap agent, using her athletic background to develop a signature killing method. She would seduce NATO officials and businessmen, then literally squeeze them to death during intimate encounters while extracting classified intelligence. For over a decade, she operated across major European cities, with at least 12 confirmed victims dying from this bizarre technique. Her targets never saw it coming, expecting pleasure, but finding death instead. Fleming's writers discovered her classified case files through intelligence contacts and adapted her methods directly for the film. The most disturbing part? One of cinema's most unbelievable villains was actually toned down from the real thing. Sometimes reality is far stranger than fiction.",en,12.56

I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it. Number one, I would invest 100% of my money in a blue chip dividend fund that paid out about 3.5% in dividends each year. There's $35,000 of pre-tax income. Number two, January 2nd of each year, I would sell an additional 4% of my stocks. There's an additional $40,000 of pre-tax income. Number three, taking my social security benefits at 62, I'll receive an additional $25,000 a year pre-tax, which will not only offset the taxes from one and two, but will allow me to live on a net of about $75,000 a year. And number four, and because I invested 100% of my money in stocks, I expect that they will continue to grow at the historical average of 8%. Even after selling 4% per year, in 16 years, my initial $1 million should be worth closer to $3.49 million, allowing me to either live off the 3% dividend yield alone for the rest of my life, or spend over $300,000 a year until I die, because now I can.

It dipped and then when it starts to make a new high this is on the one minute. I took it down so I can really see what's going on. So see once it goes up above that the body of that candle you guys then see it's pushing up and now this is a good time as well because the high is 202 you can still get in around 190 and get up. So see how it once it makes a new high it's gonna push down so you're just really watching it. If you need to sometimes it's not best to do the one minute so then you can take it to five minutes so you can see you can see that it's still going up so you could stay in this trade and then you know hopefully you'll make a new high. But you know with me like I said my strategy is once it makes the fight once it after this pullback then the next five minute candle to make a new high from this previous candles that's where I said I get in so off of,en,21.01

I want to make a crucial distinction here. I'm not saying you're going to make a lot of money if you don't work hard. You have to work hard, especially in the beginning. But once you get to a certain point, once you're making over that, I would say probably that 300 to 500k range, it's not about working harder. It's about working smarter. Making your money work for you and putting yourself in rooms where people can give you the information you need to exponentially grow. The reason for that is because once you hit a certain income threshold, your time becomes so important. And the more time you put in, the more time you put in, it's going to start revealing minimal returns because you're just one person. And that's why for a lot of people, those one-to-ones aren't really scalable business models that can get you to the multi-million if that's your goal. Once you get to that area, you have to think about how can I make my money, make money for me through systemizing, through monthly recurring revenue or hiring agents or people under me if you want to go the agency model. What can I do to work smarter, not harder? Now, there's a lot of different ways you can do this. And I just gave you some examples. If you're a business owner, right, you can do an agency model. You can look into monthly recurring revenue. You can look into more group coaching options. If you're a consultant or what you're starting to consulting business. The point is start thinking about how can I work smarter rather than harder? And the reason why, even if you're just starting, why you want to think about this is because a lot of people when they just start out, they start out in a model that is not scalable. And if your goal is financial freedom, you want to start out with a model with a business idea and format that's going to be scalable in the long run. And for those of you who work full-time, I know it's a lot of you guys, I work full-time. You also want to think about what is a model that I can actually start while in my full-time job because the goal of this is not to create another job for yourself. This is what we talk about in the prosperous woman collective. So if you're a professional woman interested in starting a business, it's for you.

My appointment starts at 9.30 so 9.30 for labs. I believe it was like 10 o'clock for clinic and then it might have been 10.15 for clinic and then 11 o'clock for infusion. So why did I not get called back for infusion until 12.30? Right. So the holdup was clinic. I'm not sure what was going on. It was packed in there. There was nowhere to sit. And I waited over an hour to even get a room. Actually more than an hour. Needless to say, I didn't pay attention while I was in clinic. So I didn't tell my nurse practitioner that I needed to leave at 1.30 because in my head, since my clinic appointment got pushed back late, in my head I thought that infusion would take me as soon as I got to the infusion check-in. But that's not what happened. I sat there for about 35 or 40 minutes before they finally called me and I was like, I need to know how long infusion is going to be because I have an appointment. Oh look, did y'all see that? My hair is growing back. Oops, sorry, that was my ADHD. I saw like a flash of white and was like, hey. But yeah, I forgot my hat. I forgot a wig. It was freezing in there. But anyway, I started crying because I thought it was the third cycle, the third infusion in my second cycle. No, today was my first infusion of my third cycle, which meant that I was getting two drugs instead of one, which meant that I need to be there for at least two and a half, three, three and a half hours because pre-meds for 30 minutes, then they want to give you fluid for 30 minutes, then they finally give you the medicines. One of them is an hour. The next one is an hour. So that's technically three hours, if not longer. Then my port has to be de-accessed. I just burst into tears. I burst into tears. The nurse was like, don't you have anybody else to take your daughter? I don't because if I did, then I wouldn't be telling you that I have to go, right? No, wrong, maybe. I don't know. Needless to say, I'm not in a good mood. I feel very teary now. Sorry. I don't want to go back and get stuck again tomorrow because it hurts. It does. It really does hurt. Port or not, they still have to stick it through your skin. So they only have to go back tomorrow for a fusion. Then they have to go back Wednesday to get the white blood cell booster shot because my insurance has given me a hard time or given them a hard time about me just getting the new LASTA auto-injector. They don't want to pay for that. So I'm not okay. I'm not. But I gotta wipe my tears. I gotta get myself together to go back to being a mom and taking care of my baby. But I just wanted to make sure that I came on today and updated y'all about my day. I usually would update you anyway about infusion and being near and everything. But today I'm really sad because now I gotta go get stuck again and I don't want to, but I have to. But at least it's gonna be at 8 o'clock in the morning tomorrow. So I'll probably get dropped off there early before Darryl takes the kids to school. But I just wanted to come on and let you guys know. Again, thank you for the prayers. Thank you for the warm wishes and thoughts. If you see me give me a hug please because I'm really too needed. I'm trying really hard to be strong. I just can't be. You know what I mean? Thank you again for checking out my MSI wish list and thank you for any donations that you send through GoFundMe. I'm gonna go now because I'm trying really hard not to cry.

On top of that, we also saw Canada come out and say that they were going to drop their tariffs against the United States. That is huge. That's huge for Americans and for Canadians. Now, the income tax part, this is very, very interesting.

In Louisiana, you as the spouse do not automatically inherit your spouse's share of the assets. Instead, their children do. That means now you share ownership of the home you paid for with your kids or your step kids. Which means if you want to remodel, refinance, or sell the home, you legally need your kids permission. Or even worse, in a blended family situation, your step kids could force the sale of your home. Luckily for you, the fix is simple. The right of state plan by your spouse will keep control of the home where it belongs with you.

And then guess what they do? They increase the rent. Not only that, but private equity firms sometimes use government-backed loans to buy these mobile parks. They know you can't just easily move your mobile home, but they own the land that that home sits on. This kind of leads to a trap, especially if they raise the rents. You pay more or you lose your spot. And like I said, a lot of these deals are backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac using taxpayers' supported money. And this is happening nationwide. The last time I heard about it was in Florida, where a TV news station was reporting on it. And in Chicago, there's a federal lawsuit right now saying that park owners coordinated together with market reports so that they all could just push up the rents together. In Illinois, park owners must give a 90-day notice to these rent price hikes. But there isn't any statewide cap on how much that can be. Although there is a bill right now that just passed through Springfield that says that there should be a 3% cap and it should also be tied to inflation. But across the nation, residents are starting to sue. Under the same notion that park owners get together and coordinate on their rent price hikes. So the entire area moves up in rents, so people have to move even farther to get away from these. Regulators did tell Fannie and Freddie that they do have to have tenant protections, especially when you finance the park. It's a good idea, but rent spikes still show up after buyouts. So what you should do when you buy one of these mobile homes is you should ask three questions. Who owns the park? Did it recently sell? And also, were there any rent price hikes in the last three years? When investors jack up the price of rents, nobody can save for down payments to then buy a home. This leads to even more home unaffordability. That pushes more buyers into bidding wars on starter family homes. What do you think? Should taxpayer-funded loans be off limits altogether? Unless there's rent price caps? Or even give residents first purchase rights? Yes or no?",en,19.26

It's called Remittance, a project built to do what XRP does best, which is instant global payments. But here's the twist. It's targeting people, not banks, which means consumer adoption could happen fast. Instead of waiting for financial institutions, Remittance is building peer-to-peer remittance rails. Go ahead, try saying that five times fast. These remittance rails let anyone send money worldwide for pennies instantly. Now, some early investors are calling this the XRP killer, claiming even faster transaction times than RippleNet and fees so low, they're almost free. Blah blah blah blah blah. Here's my take. There will always be shiny new projects to look at. Going after consumers sounds easy, but gaining mass adoption is expensive and limiting. Consumers in the U.S., for example, send about $2.5 billion per day across borders. If Remittance captured even 10% of that, and that would be generous, that's around $250 million in daily volume. Impressive, but still small compared to XRP. Contrast that to the XRP ledger. Right now, XRP already moves about $1.4 billion per day, and that's without mass banking adoption. Now imagine XRP capturing just 10% of all global cross-border payments, business and consumer combined. Global flows estimated at $100 trillion per year, that would be trillion with a T, that would be roughly $10 trillion annually settling through the XRP network. So while Remittance might be the new kid on the block, XRP is the one with the real momentum and the banking infrastructure to scale worldwide. So could Remittance actually flip XRP? Drop your opinion in the comments below if you think XRP still holds a crown, or if this new crypto is next up. By the way, the Remittance team is somewhat of a mystery, so take that into consideration if you were thinking about investing in it. It could be a rug pool, just my opinion.

Not just those drawn lines on a map, but the invisible ones marked by sovereignty, dignity, and restraint. Well, that time has passed. We now export chaos like it's corn syrup. And Donald Trump is high on his own myth. He has reached across the equator to try and rewrite the laws of another nation with nothing more than a pen and a grudge, because his buddy, Bolsonaro, is finally being held accountable. And that makes Trump nervous. Because when one of them goes down, it sets a precedent, and precedent is the one thing fascists fear more than truth. So on July 30th, Trump did what autocrats do when their friends are cornered, he threw a tantrum. But then he threw a tariff. He signed an executive order declaring a national emergency, not because of a flood, not because of famine, but because Brazil's judiciary had the gall to prosecute a criminal. He used the AEPA, which is the law meant to protect us from actual foreign threats to punish a sovereign nation for trying to hold a man accountable for plotting a coup. But he didn't stop there. He also sanctioned the justice overseeing Bolsonaro's trial. He froze his US assets, barred him from travel, and called him corrupt, authoritarian, and dangerous. And that, my friends, is projection at a geopolitical level. The same man who praised Putin, flirted with Kim, and died with Orban just accused a sitting Brazilian judge of tyranny. All for trying to preserve democracy while Trump's twin tried to light it on fire, and make no mistake, this is not about policy. This is not about trade. It's not about America first. This is very personal. It's payback. It's vengeance wrapped in the stars and stripes. And Trump doesn't give a good goddamn about soybean prices or currency volatility. He cares about Bolsonaro staying free, because Bolsonaro staying free keeps the lie alive that elections don't matter, that truth is negotiable, and that power belongs to the loudest liar in the room. But Brazil has said no. President Lula for all his flaws and scars has stood his ground. He said Brazil would not be blackmailed. He said justice wasn't up for trade. And the people met that tyranny with memes. They started a social media rebellion, a digital middle finger, if you will. They turned Trump's rage into satire, and for once the internet became a weapon for democracy instead of division. And it's beautiful. It's wild. And it's Brazilian. It's also very effective, because this time the playbook didn't work. This time the strongman threat met a people who had seen it all before, and are done being shamed. They're done being bossed, and they're done being told that their justice system is illegitimate because it dares to function. But let's not miss the point. What Trump did isn't just inappropriate. It's dangerous. He used American power to try and suppress another country's judiciary. He wielded the economy like a club, and he sanctioned a judge and a democratic nation for doing his job. You know who does that? Not Roosevelt, not Eisenhower, not Kennedy or Reagan. Not even Bush or Nixon. Tyrants do that. And it might not even hold.

They became the first school in the nation to launch a creator economy center. You can now major in being a content creator. My favorite part about being a content creator is getting to do my favorite thing about my favorite thing. We're going to do something very exciting and a national first at Syracuse University. We are going to launch Higher Education's first academic center for the creator economy. The creator economy is just exploding in the United States and literally around the world today. What you're going to see is a suite of courses offered to Syracuse University students that really take on a range of areas. We're talking about business and communication. 10, 15 years ago it was through television but now the new creators, the new content is social. I think we're all media consumers and not everyone is going to create the content but I think understanding the other side of it is also really important. I love that my Syracuse education allowed me to have this well-rounded view of what content creation is because in reality Light's camera action is only one part of it. Syracuse prepared me for that by making me a well-rounded storyteller whether it be through writing, whether it be through photography, whether it be through videos. It's more than just the content creator. It's companies, it's experiences, it's learning how to communicate with others. I love the fact that you know the rules aren't quite the same as they were 20, 30 years ago. You can get it out there within seconds to the public and you can get instant feedback. I always say that I feel so lucky because everything I learned at Syracuse gave me the tools to build my own business, create my own podcast, be recognized by the New York Times as one of the top dating and relationship podcasts in the world. It demonstrates that we're leading as it relates to engaging and connecting with this generation and future generations of students. It's so important that this is done at Syracuse because nowadays this is how you make money. Social media is the new wave, it's the new face of everything and why not being first here at Syracuse? More and more consumers rely on influencers and creators to make purchasing decisions, to think about the brands that they're going to follow and also in many cases entertain them. So bringing all these things together into one creator economy lens is really an exciting time for Syracuse University. Be a content creator and come to Syracuse.",en,23.1

But, I got a couple meetings today. That's gonna push my mission forward. So, I'm excited about that. And, also, right now, I'm just on my way up here to this courtesy Ford. This courtesy Ford dealership, mate. I've been doing this valet. This valet, you get your surf for your getting your vehicle service. So, if y'all didn't know, I'm kind of like the king of gig work. So, no excuses for not getting out here and finding some kind of hustle grind to be able to fund your business endeavors. So, I know a lot of people still working and chasing their dreams at the same time. So, what I like about the gig economy is it's right into my independent contractor. Shit that I do. I'm an independent contractor. I don't want to swipe nobody's time block no more. So, that's what it is.",en,64.1

If you worked as hard as him, you could have what he has. Hey, dipshit. You know why they call it the American dream? Because you have to be asleep to believe it. If you're stupid enough to think that anyone that starts middle class has a chance of reaching what Elon Musk has, you are delusional. A quick Google search says that the average American makes $62,000 yearly. He could spend that daily for the next 17,000 fucking years. And still not run out of money. And I know all you dipshits immediately run to that. Well, it's not all cash. All 400 billion is not cash. So he doesn't really have it. Well, guess what he can do? He can take loans out using his stock as collateral that then he pays back with further loans further in the future. With the same stocks as collateral, only they're a valued higher because stock grows. Another nifty little way to look at it is that if he lived another 40 years, which is generous given his ketamine addiction, he'd have to spend $27 million a day to run out of money. A day. That's more money than any of you will ever see in your entire lives. And yet these same people cry socialist as if they have any idea what that means when you bring up the fact that there's a serious income inequality problem in the U.S. They lick that boot so hard.",en,61.05

In short, this is one of our listings. This listing was originally built by Caruso Homes and it's huge and I'm not being hyperbolic. I'm being quite literal. This townhouse has five bedrooms, four levels, 4.5 bathrooms, a rooftop terrace, two car garage, and a massive finish basement. They even extended the kitchen cabinets into the dining room giving today's buyer so much needed storage space.
