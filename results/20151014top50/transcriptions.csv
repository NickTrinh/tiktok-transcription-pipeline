The major thing we see in Canada is that Trump is being hostile to Canada, but that's not where their problem started. The Chinese ambassador, sometimes last week, told Canada that if they remove tariffs on EV, EV or electric vehicles from China, that China will remove all tariffs on canola oil and seeds. Here's what's going on. During the Biden administration, Canada imposed tariffs, I'm talking about 100% tariffs, on Chinese electric cars. Now, Canada in reality doesn't have a problem with Chinese EVs, not at all. See, you have to see, there's one thing with Canada is that this is an oil country. They don't have anything to worry about. Look at Russia, for example, which is also an oil country. Although Chinese cars are free to go in and out of Russia, you don't see Russians addicted to electric vehicles because oil is so cheap that they don't really care for it for now. That's the same thing with Canada. Canada is an oil country. If it was governed right, in reality, Canada doesn't have a problem with China selling electric vehicle in Canada. However, Canada is not an independent country. It's a US puppet. What happened is that during the Biden administration, they put 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs. Why? Because, number one, they are better cars, right? They are cheaper and then the US cannot compete. They don't want the American people to discover how better Chinese have been come in terms of making cars. So, the auto industry, since you know, big corporation owned government in the US, they went to the government and told them, look, don't allow Chinese cars to come in here or our business will go down. And that's exactly what happened. Now, they are trying to act as though it's a normal thing. It's not normal. All they needed to do is to compete. It should inspire them to make better cars, cheaper cars. But because the industry in the US don't care about the American people, that is why the US put 100% tariffs on electric vehicles. They figured that, you know, with 100% tariffs, nobody's going to buy them. So, what they did is that they also imposed the same thing to Canada. Canada is the puppet of the US. You know, first of all, Canada has a prime minister because they belong to the British. They are under the authority of the king of the UK. But because they are very close to the US, right, they are definitely a puppet of the US. When Donald Trump came and said that Canada was going to be the 51st state, in reality, Canada has always been in additional state of the US. It is not officially like that, but the way Canada is ran is exactly like that. The US does whatever they want in Canada. The car industry in Canada doesn't really belong to Canadian. You never heard of a Canadian car, right? It's the US car industry that runs in Canada, right? So, the US runs Canada like it was a 51st state. So, when Trump came out and said that everybody's trying to scold him and, you know, and try to insult him because it's Donald Trump. But there's a lot of things Donald Trump is saying that is true, right? He's exposing what has been happening already. Canada has always been an additional state of the US, right? It's just not officially like that. But authorities in Canada never stand up to the US. They do whatever the US asks them to do. Prime example, electric vehicles from China. They put 100% tariffs, almost banning the cars, because the US imposed that they should do that. And because Canada's number one trading partner is the US, they felt like, look, we don't have a choice. They're going to punish us if we don't do what they ask us to do. After they accept it to put 100% tariffs on electric vehicles from China, China decided, okay, if you are going to do that, we will also put tariffs on canola oil and seeds. China, just like in the US with soybeans, they are the biggest buyer of canola oil and seeds from Canada. And that right there almost killed that industry in Canada. Luckily, they have some other buyers, but China was the biggest buyer. And they haven't had anyone to replace China ever since they decided to follow the US with the crazy tariffs on EVs. So their economy has been suffering. They were expecting that when Donald Trump was going to come, maybe things were going to get better. Unfortunately for them, when Donald Trump came, he made things worse. He put tariffs on Canada. He called Canada the 51st state of the US and called the prime minister a governor. That is how hostile he became to Canada. So the Canadian economy basically is crashing right now. The tariffs that Donald Trump put on them is not helping at all. It's making things worse. Then of course, China not buying their oil, being the biggest buyer, is destroying that agricultural industry. So China then proposed to them, we will remove those tariffs if you remove tariffs on EVs. Canada has not responded because they are consulting their masters, the US. They're trying to see how the US is going to react. Because like I say, the US is their number one partners in term of trading. And of course the US is not going to like that. If they remove those tariffs against China, while the US is out there trying to fight China, you know, to show the world that the US still have some type of power, it's not going to help. However, Donald Trump hasn't been good with Canada. So Canada should take this opportunity and show that they are really independent and accept this deal. The worst part about this entire thing, right, that you really need to pay attention to, is the different things that they are exchanging. Look at the US and China. The US is crying because China is not buying soybeans. So the US is exporting agricultural product to China, while China is exporting electronics, right, to the US. Back in the days, the US was the one to export technology, right? Everybody wanted, you know, the United States technology to other countries. Nowadays, the US has to rely more on sending agricultural product instead of technologies. And it's not just in China, right? People don't want to buy western electronics anymore. Not only that it's expensive, but it's not better than China. China has, you know, the most advanced technologies right now. And look at Canada. Canada is selling canola oil to China, while China is trying to sell electric vehicles. So the world has shifted. It is now China that is exporting technology around the world, while those, right, who were the gods of the world, are crying because they cannot export agricultural product. That is how the world has changed. So for those of you who think that Canada is not a 51st state of the US, let's see if they're going to take this deal. Because it's going to help them. For China to start buying canola oil and seeds again from Canada is a big deal. They have been negotiating ever since the tariffs were in place. But the thing with the West is that they are so arrogant that they think they can put tariffs on others. And then when others put tariffs on them, for them it feels like it's not a normal thing. Keep in mind they were the first one to put tariffs on China on electric vehicles. China said, okay, no problem. We put tariffs on canola product. They started acting as though China did something unthinkable here. People are not supposed to put tariffs on them when they put tariffs on others. That's how arrogant they are. Like I said, let's see because I don't believe that Canada is going to take the deal. Here's their opportunity to revive that canola industry. Let's see if they are independent enough to take the deal. If they don't take the deal, then Donald Trump was right when he said that Canada is the 51st state of the US.",en,346.94

So this is a full day of things that we ate during their last trip to New York City. We went for breakfast at Boutros, which is a Lebanese Syrian restaurant. I've already done a full, more detailed video about this restaurant, but they put a little bit of a spin on some classic Middle Eastern dishes, and it's over in Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. Then we went to Fort Green so we could get iced coffee from Evelina. I've made four to five videos about Evelina. I just love this place, and their iced coffee is so good for no reason. We did a late lunch at my absolute favorite pizza in the city called Lazarus. My dad asked for one thing the whole trip. He said, I want some pizza. And both of us prefer thin crust, so this is where I took them. We took a quick break, and then my mom and I split off to go to a brand event I was invited to. I only got one guest. It was a collaboration between Alipop and Coconut Cult. They were doing a dirty soda collab, so they put a spoonful of the probiotic yogurt in the Alipop, and they had a claw machine, and everybody was losing. It was not an easy claw machine, and my mom won a coconut. Then we met back up with my dad at Thursday Kitchen in the East Village. Really tried our luck here because they're walk-in only, and we got in. It's a Korean tapas-style restaurant, so the edamame dumplings and the mac and cheese are some of my favorites.

I was looking at Epcot's Mexico Pavilion on Google Earth as most normal people do, and from the ground it just looks like this really cool Aztec pyramid, right? You step inside and suddenly it feels like nighttime in a Mexican village, literally on match vibes. There's the market, the restaurant, the Cavadalta Kila, and of course the Grand Fiesta Boat Tour Ride. But if you zoom out on Google Earth, you'll have your chanclas blown off. That pyramid that you thought you were in the whole time is just the entrance. Everything else is actually inside this giant warehouse building behind it. This may seem obvious on Google Earth, but Disney does such a great job of this that I promise when you're inside the park you never know this building exists. Now if Disney really wants to make this pyramid magical, they need to say adios to the Calabraros Boat Ride and give us a cocoa ride. The Calabraros Ride is basically a PowerPoint presentation on a boat. Disney, if you're listening, please take my pesos and make it happen. You have four years until Coco2 comes out.",en,10.21

Most times when I see people create a campaign that doesn't succeed, it's because they've selected the wrong goals on the campaign or just the wrong settings and objectives that gives them no ability to ever see the potential of that campaign. So let's hop right into it. I am in a ad account and all you'll do once you're in your ad account, go to create, skip these three, like never select these objectives. Objectives are super important because they actually give Meta the functionality and ability to understand what's most important to you. If you select these, Meta is really good within their pool of people on their platform, understanding who is just gonna click on things and not do anything more meaningful or who's gonna watch videos and not do anything more meaningful. But if you're a business concerned about bottom line, you need sales, which is just about everybody, just select this. This is gonna save you a lot of money. And then after that, this is gonna lead you to your ad set where you can start creating your audience and start selecting what you're actually optimizing toward. So this is gonna be the most important part. Obviously, you want to name your ad set. Once you get down here, leave these the same website and maximize number of conversions. These are in most cases going to always be this setting. So you can leave these the same, make sure you select your pixel where your targeting is done or where your events and conversion tracking is set up. And then from there, you're just gonna want to make sure you're optimizing toward your purchase event. After that, the only other thing that I'd suggest is coming down here. And I do, I'm a huge, huge fan of broad targeting. I don't like to over target in Meta because the creative does the targeting in Meta in 2025. But I will do this, you're gonna want to click this audience tab, go to switch setup. And I at least want to make sure I would add in an audience exclusion, I'm not going to type it in here, but you would add in the audience for your existing customers to exclude them because you want this to be complete prospecting effort. After that, all you're going to do is create your ad from there. And so you'll obviously set up your ad. And then the only other thing that I'd say is you're going to want to add your UTM parameters. These UTM parameters are going to be huge if you're tracking things on triple whale or even in Shopify to understand the attribution of your Facebook ad, meaning how successful and how incremental to my top line sales is are these campaigns or are individual ads. So that is, those are like the biggest three things, make sure you select the right objective, make sure you optimize for the right purchase event, set up your audience exclusions and then I guess four things, and then make sure you add your UTM parameters to your ad level and then launch. And then I'd set, in terms of setting the budget, that's probably another video, but that is essentially how you set up your campaign properly to give yourself the best chance of success.",en,22.32

We trade numbers, not gold, promises, not payment. Debt isn't chains, it's belief. A faith that tomorrow will come and will keep working to pay for today. Governments borrow from banks, banks borrow from markets, markets borrow from home. A circle that keeps spinning, because we all agree it should. Debt only works if no one stops believing. If we all decided it wasn't real, the numbers would stay, but their power would vanish. Maybe that's the secret. Money isn't the illusion, confidence is.

The US government could be preparing to take stakes in several small stocks. And if this happens, they could jump fast. So here's what I'm watching. We have already seen what this kind of move can do. Just like at UAMY, which is a stock that our group spotted early, around $8 a share, and it shot up over 100% in a week once the sector started heating up. That's why I'm now watching a few other names that could be next if the government steps in with funding or equity stakes. The first one is Uranium Energy Corp, which is ticker symbol UUUU. This one plays right into America's growing focus on nuclear energy. The second potential stock is USA Rare Earth, ticker symbol USAR. This company focuses on the same rare earth materials that the US needs for defense and electric vehicles. And the third stock I'm watching is Perpetua Resources, ticker symbol PPTA. This is a company that is already on the government's radar because of its involvement in strategic mineral projects. I'm keeping an eye on volume insider buying and any headlines that suggest government involvement because those are the signals that tend to show up before big breakouts. And with that said, these three stocks are definitely high risk high reward plays, but like I said, if the government does take a stake, the upside could be massive.

They're prescription pill bottle labels that you clip onto your pill bottles. So you take a label, flip it onto the bottle, and then you can use the Sharpie that it's included. Write the name of your prescription or what it's for. If it's your heart medicine, you can write heart. You can write things like dosage. And if you make a mistake when writing, so this is permanent marker. That way it doesn't smear. But we also give you alcohol wipes.

Step one, sear your meat. Both sides, you're gonna grab a chuck roast, you could use short ribs. Chuck roast is best for this, no bones. Give it a nice sear. Pull it out in a pot. You seared your meat in, you're gonna go in with onion, celery, carrot, roughly chopped. You're gonna give that a nice mix, cook it down a little bit. You're gonna go in with onion, garlic powder, pepper, and a little milkmeg. Give it another mix. Super simple, amount of whole lot of spices. You're gonna go in with two tablespoons of all-purpose flour. I like to go one tablespoon, give it a mix, and then another tablespoon, give it a mix. You're gonna go in with a tablespoon of better than beef bouillon. It's a beef base and a tablespoon of tomato paste. You're gonna give that a nice mix and let it cook down and caramelize. And we're gonna deglaze with red wine. I'm gonna go in with about a half bottle to three quarters of a bottle. Then you can have a glass yourself. And I'm gonna let that kind of come up to a simmer. And then we're gonna toss in three cups of beef broth. I like to get my meat in the pot before I put the beef broth in, but it really doesn't matter. There's no proper order of operations here. So I'm just tossing that in. I'm gonna cover the meat with beef broth, about three cups, like I said. It could be less if you're using less meat or more if you want more broth. And then I'm gonna put in a couple sprigs of thyme and rosemary. The last thing you're gonna do is you're gonna put a bulb of garlic in here, just chopped in half. You're gonna let that simmer in there. It's gonna come in handy later for those mashed potatoes, but it also just adds a ton of flavor. Once that comes up to a simmer, give it a cover, and you're ready to chill for two and a half for three hours. I'm gonna give it a quick check with my awesome oven mitt. Everything's ready to rip, and on to the next step. I'm gonna pull out all the contents of this dish so I can just have the broth in that pot, and we're gonna put a cornstarch slurry in there and thicken this up a little bit. I want like a gravy stew vibe, so if it's too thin, this is your move to make that happen. Just gonna put that back in there, let it simmer for another 20 minutes while you make your mashed potatoes. This is my new favorite way to make mashed potatoes. It's almost like a potato ricer. I'm gonna throw in an egg yolk, and then that garlic that I had simmering in the dish, and it is just such an amazing addition of flavor to these mashed potatoes, little cream and butter in there, and this thing is ready to plate. This is honestly the perfect beef stew. It's super easy to make, and it is packed with flavor. Wow, whoa. That is so good.",en,25.7

I feel like anything warm that I can eat from a bowl with a spoon has definitely earned its spot on my list of cozy meals. Welcome back to part eight of my cozy soups and stew series. The hardest part about this recipe is making the roux. With etouffee, you don't want it as dark as when you're making gumbo, but you still want a nice chocolate brown color. So I continuously stirred equal parts butter and flour over medium heat until it did just that. Then I turned the heat up to medium high, added in my bell peppers, onions, and celery to cook down for a few minutes before putting in my garlic to saute until fragrant and allowing my spices to bloom. Next, we're going to add in the seafood stock and of course I'm using my little hack whenever I want to make a quick broth and to boost the flavor in any of my recipes. I'm combining the butter dem bouillon lobster base with some hot water, which is going to add so much flavor to our etouffee. Throw in a couple bay leaves and let it come to a boil and at this step, you can add a few dashes of hot sauce or cayenne pepper if you want to add an extra cake. Once it's to a boil, reduce the heat to medium low and allow it to come together for about 20 minutes covered. The consistency should be more of a stew, so after the 20 minutes, you'll see that the roux has thickened up our etouffee. Remove the bay leaves and then add in fresh parsley and the crawfish tells and we're going to mix that in and just give it about another four to five minutes so the crawfish can heat through and get fully incorporated. I served it up with some rice topped up with fresh green onions and y'all. I even made some black and salmon the next day to put the crawfish etouffee I had left over on top and all I could say is once again another hit for a one pack Aussie recipe.",en,15.88
